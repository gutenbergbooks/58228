<h2>ABOUT INDIAN LEGENDS</h2>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE Indians neither built monuments nor
wrote books. The only records they
made were those picture writings
known in after years as wampum,
which were mere symbols, recording feats of arms.
Consequently, all that is known of them prior to the
coming to America of Europeans is traditional or
conjectural. Not a page of their history has ever
been written by any save their foes, and the history
thus written is so distorted and marred by prejudice
that much of it is misleading.</p>

<p>In the veins of the red man ran the wild poetry
and imagination of the hunt, the chase, the battle,
the capture, the dance, the forests, the valleys,
the mountains, the streams, lakes and rivers, for a
thousand generations; and yet they were without
accomplishment in letters or arts. Is it, therefore,
strange that they held in great reverence the traditions
and legends common in their tribes&mdash;revered
them as the early Christians revered the first copies
of the sacred writings? These legends were told
over again and again for unknown years. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
were transmitted from one to another, as the unwritten
work of Freemasonry has been transmitted
by frequent and careful repetition. They were not
bandied about like ordinary stories, but, repeated
with something of a religious or sacramental spirit,
as though the tales imparted an especial virtue to
those who learned them from reliable sources; were
held as sacred as we hold the transactions of an
honored secret society.</p>

<p>The legends common to one clan were known all
over the continent wherever Indians of that clan
lived, and there is little doubt that many of the
legends of the Iroquois can be found in some form
among those of the Western Indian tribes of the
present time. Yet the traditions of the Iroquois
herein contained are known positively to be two
hundred years old, and are confidently believed to
be the stories told by the red men thousands of
years ago.</p>

<p>The Indians never explained anything by the
science of natural philosophy. Every effect had to
them a mysterious, supernatural cause. They could
not comprehend how sound thrown against an obstructing
surface would be repeated and form an
echo. Instead they found supernatural reasons for the
phenomenon, and certainly very pretty ones. Only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span>
the absurdity of their ideas may appear to some, for
in the light of present intelligence they are absurd,
but, none the less, they are beautiful. If our forefathers
had taken more interest in the peoples they
found on the Western Continent, spending less of
their energies in devising plans for cheating the Indians
out of their furs and lands&mdash;a policy their descendants
have closely followed and admirably succeeded
in&mdash;our libraries might contain volumes of
fairy tales that would delight the youth of many
generations.</p>

<p>It is not too much to ask the reader to remember
that these stories were told in the homes of the red
men many centuries ago, long before they learned
from the whites the cruel, heartless, treacherous
and vindictive characteristics that unfair history has
fastened upon them as natural and inherent traits.
If this is borne in mind, the perusal and study of
these stories will, it is believed, give as much pleasure
to the reader as the study of the Indian character,
made necessary in order to properly clothe their
almost forgotten legends with something like their
original embellishment, has given the author.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">I</span>T is not the purpose of this volume to
deal to any considerable extent with the
history of the Indians, but simply to
present some of the legends of the Iroquois.
To the reader or student, however, is due a
brief statement as to the authority from which the
folk-lore contained herein has been drawn, that there
may remain no question as to its reliability.</p>

<p>A few years after the close of the war of the
Revolution one of the pioneers of Western New
York, who was in the service of the Holland Land
Company, made the acquaintance and won the
friendship of the Seneca chief, the Cornplanter,
(Gy-ant-wah-chi, or, as written by some authorities,
Gar-yan-wah-ga). The friendship continued as
long as the two men lived and was marked by its
cordiality. In their intercourse they were thrown
together many winters, and the Cornplanter was
led to talk freely of his people, their past, their
present condition, and their future, and it was during
these confidences that the Indian told his white
friend many of the Iroquois legends. To the recollections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span>
of the Cornplanter was added the knowledge
possessed upon the subject by the Nephew
(Governor Blacksnake), who resided upon the
same reservation and in the immediate vicinity, and
that of "other old men and leaders of these Indians."
The legends were preserved in outline notes upon
the blank pages of some diaries and civil engineer
field-books which the white man was accustomed
to keep; and these outlines, with full oral explanations
came finally into the possession of the present
writer. About twenty-five years ago the work of
their further verification by means of inquiries made
of some of the most intelligent Indians in New York
State was commenced. Many of those consulted
had only imperfect knowledge of the legends, others
knew one or more of the stories, and, by aid of the
outlines referred to above, were able to assist in the
work of their restoration. Among those who gave
most valuable assistance was Simon Blackchief and
his mother. The latter spoke only in the Indian
tongue, and her version of such of the stories as she
had heard in her girlhood was translated by her
son. Chief John Mountpleasant, Harrison Halftown,
Elias Johnson and John Kinjocity also gave valuable
assistance. The late B. Giles Casler, who was the
United States Indian Agent for New York State for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"> 17 </a></span>
a term of years, accompanied the author upon a
number of visits to several of the reservations.
Through these helps, and by a study pursued under
the favoring circumstance of former residence in
close proximity to the Allegany Reservation, the
present writer believes that he has succeeded in
bringing these legends to a point approximating
their original beauty. In their elaboration care has
been taken not to depart from the simplicity and
directness of statement characteristic of the Indian,
and only such additions that seemed to be warranted
have been made. Whenever the primary authority
for a legend is other than the Cornplanter, the fact
is mentioned in the appended notes.</p>

<p>Although the Cornplanter was a half-breed, he
was more thoroughly acquainted with the traditions
of his people than any contemporary chief in the
nations comprising the Iroquois. He was born in
Conewangus, on the Genesee river, probably in the
year 1732, and died on Cornplanter Island in the Allegany
river, in the State of Pennsylvania, near the New
York line, March 7, 1836, at the age of one hundred
and four years. He was the son of John Abeel (also
written O'Bail), a trader among the Indians. His
mother was an Indian Princess of the Turtle Clan.</p>

<p>From his earliest recollection the Cornplanter had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18 </a></span>
a pronounced hatred of the whites, caused, no
doubt, by the remembrance of the cruel treatment to
which his mother was subjected by his father, who
seems to have taken an Indian wife in order that he
might gain the friendship of the Indians, and thus
secure good bargains in trade. The errors of history
have led us to believe that love or respect for
a mother were sentiments almost foreign to the Indian
race. These feelings always existed among
them, however, to a much greater degree than we
are willing to concede, though their respect and
love for women and children were greater before
their simple natures were blunted and distorted by
the vicious practices of the invading Europeans.</p>

<p>The Cornplanter spent his early years at the council-fires,
and became one of the most celebrated
orators in the Confederation of the Six Nations. He
traveled from village to village and sought wisdom
from the sages of the Iroquois. It was during this
portion of his life that he listened to the traditions
that had descended from chief to chief over a period
of three centuries. When he had acquired a reputation
for bravery and woodcraft second to none of his
race, he was unanimously chosen Chief of the Senecas,
and came at once into prominence as the leader
of the war-parties of that nation in alliance with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span>
French against the English. He was present at the
defeat of Braddock, and, for a long time, by the most
daring and cruel raids on the frontier settlements,
spread destruction in the Mohawk Valley and in
Western New York. He was at that time an implacable
foe to all white people, and the names of
Cornplanter, Brant, and Red Jacket were synonymous
with capture, torture and massacre. They were
the chief councilors and leaders of their people and
fought against every overture made by the whites.
In 1779, near the mouth of Redbank Creek, in
Pennsylvania, the Cornplanter, with a large force of
Indians, engaged in battle against a party of whites,
led by Captain Samuel Brady. The engagement
terminated in favor of the whites, and many of the
Indians were killed or wounded. The survivors
fled to the river, then swollen with the spring rains,
and dashed into its current. Few succeeded in
crossing; one by one they were swept down the
stream or sank, pierced by the bullets of Brady's
men. The Cornplanter reached the opposite shore
almost alone. From that moment the high spirit of
the daring chieftain began to falter and he sought
peace, making, in 1791, a treaty with "The
Great Chief of the Thirteen Fires." The medal and
other mementos given him by Washington are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span>
still preserved by the descendants of the chief. He
was put in possession of the island that bears his
name, and ever afterwards devoted himself to farming
and pursuits of peace. For many years he
labored faithfully to eradicate the habits of intemperance
into which his people had fallen, and,
strange as it may seem, was the first temperance
lecturer in the United States. He entertained the
highest respect for Washington, and visited him
several times in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It was during the last twenty years of the Cornplanter's
life that the legends herein contained were
recalled and told. He did not speak of them generally,
for he held them sacred, but reserved them for
the ears of those in full sympathy with the people of
which he was one of the last true representatives.
He told them with an intensity of feeling that
was pitiful, for it was plain he realized that the
greatness of his people had disappeared, leaving
neither monuments nor achievements to mark their
place in the history of the world.</p>

<p>The Cornplanter died a strong believer in the religion
of the red men, and looked forward with an
eye of faith towards the Happy Hunting-Grounds,
for which countless generations of his people had
been taught to hope.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">T</span>HERE was peace in the land of the
Senecas. The red men were away
upon the chase, or busied themselves
in fashioning the arrow-points and in
shaping the mighty bows from which the shafts of
death were sent forth when food was needed in the
wigwam. The Indian women stooped among the
blades of growing corn and tilled the soil between
the thrifty stalks with sharp-pointed branches from
the strong young hickory. The children ran and
leaped in the sunshine and their laughter filled the
air and mingled with the low, crooning songs of
the old men and women who watched them, while
dreams of their youth rose like phantoms from the
past. Under the fresh verdure of a new-born summer,
groups of the young men and maidens were
plaiting the soft and flexible willows into baskets,
mats and coverings. Abroad on the hills the medicine
men roamed, marking the places where the
prized and cherished herbs that drove away the bad
spirits of suffering and sickness had put forth their
vigorous shoots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24 </a></span></p>

<p>There was peace in the land of the Senecas, and
for many moons they had waged no war against
their brothers. Their villages were growing in
strength; their numbers were increasing in greatness.
The young men were taught to follow the
chase, but their ears had drunk the stones of wars,
and their hearts burned to be upon the trail, seeking
conquest over the powerful tribes of the Mohawks,
Onondagas or Oneidas. When the soft winds
came, some of them said to their elders, "We will
go into the country of the Mohawks and learn from
our brothers there if the Manito gave them corn for
the winter, and if the venison was sweet to their
tongues."</p>

<p>Five suns they threaded the forests and sported
along the pleasant streams. At last they came upon
some young men and maidens of the Mohawk nation
engaged in preparing the ground for the maize.
Forgetting the counsels of their elders, or heedless
of what they had said to them, and eager to show
their cunning, they surprised and bound the young
Mohawks and carried them away as captives toward
the land of the Senecas.</p>

<p>When they had passed the homes of the Onondagas,
which they did without discovery, they released
one of the young men and told him to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25 </a></span>
back to the Mohawks and say to them that they
would find their maidens in the wigwams of the
Senecas, their young men slaves in the villages.</p>

<p>The wise men and sachems of the council shook,
their heads gravely when the young warriors boasted
of their conquest, for they knew that the peace of
the Senecas was broken.</p>

<p>A few days had passed, when, one evening as the
fires began to cast their red lights against the rough
sides of the great trees, five Mohawk warriors appeared
at the council village of the Senecas.</p>

<p>"Let the swift runners say to the chiefs of the
Senecas that the warriors of the Mohawks have been
long upon the trail and must not sleep. By the
light of the council-fire they would tell the message
that is sweet to the tongues of the Mohawks but
which will burn the ears of the Senecas who listen."
Thus spoke Orontadeka, the strong chief of the
Mohawks, as he strode to the council-place of the
Senecas, followed by the four solemn and determined
sachems who accompanied him on the mission.
They at once took seats upon the ground
and in silence awaited the coming of the Senecas.</p>

<p>Soon the fire-keepers of the tribe came to the
council-place, and with due ceremony started three
fires. When the last was lighted, the Seneca chiefs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> 26 </a></span>
sachems and warriors took their stations in silence
around the blazing resinous wood. Dark forms
hurried from the well-beaten paths which led
through the forest to the different villages of the
Senecas, and, without a word or sign of recognition,
the warriors who had been notified by the
swift runners and had come from their distant
homes, took their places by the council-fire. At
length, when all had assembled, the Seneca chief,
Kanyego, arose and said:</p>

<p>"Will the great chiefs of the Mohawks eat?"</p>

<p>"The Mohawks have heavy trouble on their
hearts and the food of the Senecas would choke
their voices," replied Orontadeka.</p>

<p>"Shall the bowl of the pipe be filled, that the
Mohawks may be happy in its visions?" again
asked Kanyego.</p>

<p>"The Mohawks would see clearly, and the clouds
from the peacemaker might blind their eyes," was
the reply.</p>

<p>"The Senecas have food for their brothers, the
Mohawks, and the fire-keepers have in readiness
the pipe that the Great Spirit gave to our fathers,"
said Kanyego. "The Senecas also have ears to
hear what the Mohawks would say. Let Orontadeka
speak."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> 27 </a></span></p>

<p>Rising suddenly from his crouching position on
the ground, Orontadeka walked rapidly around the
council-fires several times and then addressed the
assemblage:</p>

<p>"My Brothers: When the warm suns came and
the death-sheets of snow that covered the ground
were turned to leaping streams of laughing water,
the Mohawks were happy in their homes, where
Kanyego has many times smoked the pipe of peace
and eaten the food given him by his brothers. The
plague had not come from its home in the north
during the winter, and the wigwams were fat with
their store of corn and beans. The swift runners
went away to the shining waters beyond the big
mountains, and after many suns they returned to say
that the enemies of the Mohawks had gone beyond
the great pine trees and would plant and till new
fields and follow the chase in strange forests.</p>

<p>"My Brothers: The Mohawks were happy, for
their wigwams had need to be made greater, and
there is much work for the men to do. The women
and children sang because the warriors went not
upon the trail, and the old men turned their thoughts
to the passing of peaceful days in the villages. Suddenly
an alarm came to our ears, and the hopes in
our hearts fled in terror. As the red fox steals upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> 28 </a></span>
the nest of the partridge and carries her chickens
away to his home in the rocks, so came those who
should be our friends and took as prisoners three of
our young men and their five sisters. When the
great light drew within the door of his wigwam,
the people in the village looked in vain for the coming
of their children. The grief of the lonely parents
whose children were lost went out to all our villages.
After seven suns a party of our warriors
came upon one of the young men wandering alone
and without food in the forest. Then to our wondering
ears came the story that his brothers were
slaves in the land of the Senecas, and that his sisters
had become the wives of the Seneca robbers.</p>

<p>"My Brothers: The council-fire was lighted at
night, for the Mohawks must talk of war. Gwagonsha
stood before his people and told them how
he had heard the birds and the wind talking together
in the tree-tops, and how they agreed between
them that the Senecas had wandered away
toward the warm lands, and the wolves now lived
in their deserted lodges. Owennogon said that
even the fishes knew that the Senecas were afraid
to seek their slaves in the Cat Nation beyond the
thundering waters, and for that reason they had
sent out scouts to steal children. Kanentagoura
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> 29 </a></span>
stood before the council-fire and said that the women
of the Senecas were no longer young, but
came into the world with many moons upon their
heads, while their backs were bent with age, and
wrinkles were upon their faces. If the Seneca warriors
would have wives they must steal them from
the Mohawks, the Onondagas or the Oneidas, for
they had no wampum or canoes with which to buy
them. Kantaga told his people that their arrows
must be made ready and the thongs of their bows
must be strengthened. If the Senecas had gone
away to the warm lands, and wolves had taken
possession of their villages, the wolves must be
killed, for they were dangerous animals. If the
Senecas had become cowards and were afraid to
seek their slaves in the Cat Nation, they should be
killed, for the earth had no room upon it for cowards.
Or, if the women of the Senecas were such
monsters that they could not be taken as wives,
and the Senecas had no wampum or canoes with
which to buy maidens for their wigwams, then
they must surely be killed, for the Great Spirit was
displeased with them.</p>

<p>"My Brothers: The warriors of the Mohawks set
out at once through the forest-paths for the land of
the Senecas, and when they reached the village of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"> 30 </a></span>
Onondagas they told them the cause of their journey,
and the warriors of the Onondagas left their
lodges to the care of the old men and women and
followed the Mohawks on the trail. They remain
beside the long waters while Orontadeka and his
friends visit the council-fire of the Senecas. We
look around us and we find that some of the stories
told of the Senecas are not true. The Senecas still
inhabit their own lodges, and have not been driven
away by wolves. Upon your streams and lakes
are plenty of canoes, and in the wigwams hang
many strings of wampum. The women of the
Senecas are not old and ugly, for we see maidens
here whose eyes are like the fires lighted by the
Great Spirit when the sun has gone in his wigwam,
and whose forms are straight as the ash
trees.</p>

<p>"But we know that the young men of the Mohawks
were made slaves in the villages of the Senecas,
and that the Mohawk maidens are now the
wives of your young chiefs. We are full of sorrow.
We have not sought war, and we know that much
suffering must be the result, for the warriors of the
Mohawks and the Onondagas are many and their
arrows are long. They will burn your villages and
send many of your warriors to their long journey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> 31 </a></span>
Your wives and little ones will be driven helpless
into the forest, and your old men will speak wisdom
only to the fishes. The Senecas are child-stealers
and cowards, and the Mohawks and Onondagas
will drive them to the warm lands, where
they can wear the tobacco pouches of the women
and become slaves."</p>

<p>A murmur of sharp anger ran through the crowd
of listening Senecas when these bold words were
spoken by Orontadeka. A sudden gesture of Kanyego,
chief of the Senecas, suppressed it, however,
and he rose to make his reply. For a long time he
stood silent, with folded arms and bent head, and
then he said:</p>

<p>"My Brothers: When Orontadeka, the Mohawk,
has walked forth in the forest and has watched
the young of the bear at play, he has seen that
they are never still, but are full of life and daring
deeds, even though their parents reprove them
with harsh voices. So has my brother seen the
fawns run like the wind across the plains, darting
back and forth as though they could never tire, until
their elders draw in a circle about them and will
not let them out. My brother knows that the
young men are as full of life as the young animals,
and, like the storms, cannot be restrained in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32 </a></span>
course by those who look upon their destructive
ways with fear.</p>

<p>"When the young men of the Senecas journeyed
on the trail they were counseled by their elders to
be wise, but their ears were stopped and their eyes
were closed to the dangers that lay in their path.
They forgot what had been told them, and from the
homes of the Mohawks they brought maidens for
their wigwams. They had fears that the young
Mohawk braves would be lost in the forest without
the maidens to guide them, and so they led them to
the land of the Senecas, where they might be taught
to fashion the bow and be of use to the women in
keeping the birds from the corn. The chiefs and
sachems of the Senecas were not pleased that their
young warriors should have done this, but young
men should never be punished for deeds of bravery,
even when they have forgotten the wise counsel of
the old men, lest they become cowards.</p>

<p>"My Brothers: If the Mohawks had come to the
council-fire of the Senecas and asked that canoes
and wampum and the warm furs of the bear and
the beaver be given them for their maidens the
council would have heeded their request, for have
we not plenty? Even the young Mohawks would
have been returned to the care of their fathers, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> 33 </a></span>
that they might be kept safe and not become wanderers
where the wolves and panthers might harm
them. But the Mohawks have not thought best to
do this, and have come to the council-fire at night,
when only war can be talked. They have refused
to eat the food offered them by the Senecas, and
when the fire-keepers would light the peace-pipe,
they turned their heads. They come to tell us that
the warriors of the Mohawks have aroused the warriors
of the Onondagas, who are now upon the trail,
ready and waiting to destroy the homes of the Senecas,
and anxious to drive us from the land the Great
Spirit gave us.</p>

<p>"When the red men of the valley have come to
the council-fire of the Senecas without threats of
war in their mouths they have always been welcome,
and when they had talked they departed in
peace. But now they come as spies and say that
we are cowards, and bring the Mohawk and Onondaga
warriors behind them to destroy our villages.
For this reason let the Mohawk chiefs remain at our
council-fire and the young Mohawk men and women
will be brought to keep them company. If the
warriors of the Mohawks and Onondagas come too
close to the village of the Senecas they will see
Orontadeka and his friends start forth on the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> 34 </a></span>
journey, and they will know that many will be sent
to follow the same trail."</p>

<p>The Mohawks were wholly unprepared for this
turn of affairs, which must have been agreed upon
by the Senecas before the council opened. They
were quickly bound as prisoners. When the dawn
broke the five Mohawk chiefs, with the maidens
and young men who had been stolen from their
homes, were held under a strong guard on a slight
eminence near the village, and the order had been
given that if the invading warriors approached the
village Orontadeka and his fellow-prisoners should
at once be put to death. Scores of Seneca scouts
were scouring the woods in every direction, and a
young Seneca, fearless of the dangers to which he
was exposed, had long ago started on his way to
the camp of the superior force to inform them that
the Mohawk chiefs were held as hostages. He fulfilled
his mission and was at once made a prisoner.</p>

<p>In the Seneca village all was activity. The women
and children were making ready to hurry away under
guard, while the warriors were planning ambuscades,
in order that they might hold back the
attacking force as long as possible and cover the
escape of their women and children toward the
south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35 </a></span></p>

<p>The sun rose higher in the heavens and the scouts
of the Senecas returned one by one from the forest,
telling of the advance of a great war-party of Mohawks
and Onondagas. Nearer and nearer they approached,
evidently believing that their great numbers
rendered caution unnecessary, and that the
Senecas would either flee in panic or sue for peace
at whatever terms the invaders might dictate. A
short distance from the village a party of five Senecas
came forward to meet them, and in loud voices
warned their foes to approach no nearer if they
would save the lives of their chiefs and of the Indian
boys and girls held as prisoners with them. A halt
was called and the attacking party was upon the
point of parleying with the Senecas when the voice
of Orontadeka was heard:</p>

<p>"The Senecas should be driven away by the
warriors of the Mohawks and the Onondagas," he
cried, "for not only are they child-stealers and
cowards, but traitors, who have forgotten that the
Great Spirit made the council-fire and commanded
that it should not be violated. Orontadeka is ready
to go on his long journey. Let the warriors advance
and see the cowards run through the forest.
Orontadeka and his friends will teach them how to
die."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36 </a></span></p>

<p>The guards over the captive Mohawks seized
their victims and raised their heavy stone-hatchets
to strike the death-blows. The Mohawks and
Onondagas knew that advance on their part
meant certain death to their chiefs and the other
prisoners, but they prepared to go forward with a
rush.</p>

<p>Then the voice of one of the young Mohawk girls
rose in a cry that fastened the attention of the warriors
of both parties. Her gaze was directed toward
the sun, and from her lips came words that carried
fear and consternation to all their hearts.</p>

<p>"See, see, my Brothers! The Great Spirit hides
his smiling face and will not look upon the battle
of the red men. He will go away and leave them
in darkness if they burn the villages and with their
poisoned arrows send the hunters and the women
and the children on their long journey before they
have been called. Look thou, my brothers, he has
seen the Mohawk maidens happy in the lodges of
the Senecas, and he will not look upon them in
misery and death. He hides his face, my brothers!
He hides his face!"</p>

<p>A moan of terrible fear went up from the warriors
men who could meet death on the chase or
in the battle with a smile were unnerved by that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> 37 </a></span>
awful spectacle. They saw a black disc moving
forward over the face of an unclouded sun.</p>

<p>The guards released their prisoners and fell at
their feet. Mohawks, Senecas and Onondagas
mingled, imploring each other for pardon and protesting
the most profound friendship. The Seneca
women and children hurried from the woods,
where they had been in hiding, and lent their voices
to the general clamor of fear. The wild, savage
faces, streaked with the various colored earths and
pigments, were turned in fearful apprehension toward
the fast-darkening heavens, becoming wilder
and more savage by the terrible fear that filled them.
The sachems and wise men hid their faces in their
fur robes, and the warriors groveled in terror upon
the ground. The eagle, the hawk and flocks of
smaller birds darted blindly among the branches of
the trees, while strange cries of alarm and distress
came from every side. The panther and the bear
ran whimpering and whining with the rabbit; the
fox and other denizens of the forest sought the
frightened red men for protection, or lay trembling
and panting under the cover of some prostrate giant
of the forest.</p>

<p>On, on crept that fearful black shadow, eating its
way into the disc of the beautiful sun, like a mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> 38 </a></span>
demon that had come to blot out of existence the
source of light and warmth and life, while over the
fresh and budding earth spread the ghostly gloom
that never fails to inspire the most careless observer
with awe. The flowers that filled the woods with
such profusion closed as though night had suddenly
fallen upon them; the warmth and fragrance of the
day that had opened with such glory gave way to
the damps of evening, while the stars and planets
appeared again in the heavens. Over the whole
face of nature was thrown an unearthly, cadaverous
hue, and in the sudden chill everything was cold
and sodden with the falling dew.</p>

<p>At last, through that awful gloom, the frightened
and trembling red men saw the once tall and erect,
but now bent and tottering, form of Sagoyountha,
the aged sachem of the Senecas, creeping forth from
his wigwam. Reaching the center of the terror-stricken
assemblage, the aged man appeared to be
suddenly endowed with the vigor of youth, and
stood before them like a mighty warrior, while his
scarred and wrinkled face, upon which had beaten
the storms of more than a hundred winters, was
turned toward the dread spectacle in the heavens, the
like of which even Sagoyountha had never looked
upon. His voice rang once more with the clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> 39 </a></span>
tones that had awakened the echoes of the forests
long before any of his listeners were born, and it
sounded strangely sharp and loud in the awesome
silence that prevailed.</p>

<p>"My children, Sagoyountha speaks to you in the
voice of the past, but his eyes are looking into the
future. The Great Spirit is angry with his children,
for he would have them live in peace. He has
drawn the door of his wigwam before his smiling
face, and his children will see him no more, unless
they smoke the pipe that he gave their fathers
when he sent them forth from the Happy Hunting-Grounds.
Sagoyountha has spoken. Will his
children hear his voice?"</p>

<p>Kanyego sprang from the ground as though
stung by an adder, and, crouching low, ran rapidly
to the village. He was absent but a few moments,
and came running once more to the circle of chiefs,
bearing in his hands the sacred pipe, in which was
glowing the fragrant tobacco. From one to another
it was hastily passed, while the anxious faces were
upturned in mute appeal towards the darkened sun.</p>

<p>Look! ah, look! The aged Sagoyountha reaches
out his arms in supplication, and the bright and
dazzling edge of the beautiful orb of day once more
appears!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> 40 </a></span></p>

<p>Shouts of joy arise from the red men, while the
women and children cry aloud with gladness, as
hope once more comes to their hearts. The aged
Sagoyountha sinks to the ground, and, with feeble
voice and trembling lips, commences the chanting
of his death-song. Fainter and fainter are the
words borne upon the air as the light of the sun increases,
and, finally, the breathless throng lose the
tones wafted back from the journeying spirit as it
reaches the very portals of the Happy Hunting-Grounds.</p>

<p>In the light of the twice-dawned day, and in the
presence of the sacred dead, who had pointed out
to the red men the path by which to escape the displeasure
of their Father, the Confederacy of the
Iroquois was formed.</p>

</div>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">M</span>ANY, many moons ago there lived an
old man alone in his lodge beside a
frozen stream in the great forest beyond
the wide waters of the northern lakes.
His locks were long and white with age and
frost. The fur of the bear and cunning beaver
covered his body, but none too warmly, for snow
and ice were everywhere. Over all the earth there
was winter. The winds came down the bleak
mountain sides and wildly hurried through the
branches of the trees and bushes, looking for song-birds
that they might chill to the heart. Even the
evil spirits shivered in the desolation and sought to
dig for themselves sheltering caves in the deep
snow and ice. Lonely and halting the old man
went abroad in the forest, looking for the broken
branches that had fallen from the trees that he might
keep alive the fire in his lodge. Few fagots could he
find, and in despair he again sought his lodge, where,
hovering over the fading embers on his hearth, he
cried in anguish to the Great Spirit that he might
not perish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> 42 </a></span></p>

<p>Then the wind moaned in the tree-tops and circling
through the forests came back and blew aside
the skin of the great bear hanging over his lodge
door, and, lo! a beautiful maiden entered. Her
cheeks were red like the leaves of wild roses; her
eyes were large and glowed like the eyes of the
fawn at night; her hair was black as the wing of
the crow, and so long that it brushed the ground
as she walked. Her hands were clad in willow
buds; over her head was a crown of flowers; her
mantle was woven with sweet grasses and ferns,
and her moccasins were white lilies, laced and embroidered
with the petals of honeysuckle. When
she breathed, the air of the lodge became warm,
and the cold winds rushed back in affright.</p>

<p>The old man looked in wonder at his strange
visitor, and then opened his lips and said: "My
daughter, thou art welcome to the poor shelter of
my cheerless lodge. It is lonely and desolate, and
the Great Spirit has covered the fallen branches of
the trees with his death-cloth that I may not find
them and light again the fire of my lodge. Come,
sit thou here and tell me whom thou art that thou
dost wander like the deer in the forest. Tell me
also of thy country and what people gave thee such
beauty and grace, and then I, the desolate Manito,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"> 43 </a></span>
will tell thee of my victories till thou dost weary of
my greatness."</p>

<p>The maiden smiled, and the sunlight streamed
forth and shot its warmth through the roof of the
lodge. The desolate Manito filled his pipe of friendship,
and when he had drawn of the fragrant tobacco,
he said: "When I, the Manito, blow the
breath from my nostrils the waters of the river
stand still, the great waves on the lakes rest,
and the murmurings of the streams die away in
silence."</p>

<p>Then the maiden said: "The Manito is great and
strong and the waters know the touch of his breath;
but when I, the loved of the birds, smile, the flowers
spring up over all the forest and the plains are covered
with a carpet of green."</p>

<p>Then said the Manito: "I shake my locks, and
lo! the earth is wrapped in the death-cloth of snow."</p>

<p>Then the maiden replied: "I breathe into the air
and the warm rains come and the death-cloth vanishes
like the darkness when the great fire awakens
from its bed in the morning."</p>

<p>Then the Manito said: "When I walk about, the
leaves die on the trees and fall to the ground; the
birds desert their nests and fly away beyond the
lakes; the animals bury themselves in holes in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"> 44 </a></span>
earth or in caves in the mountain side, and the
winds wail the death-chant over all the land."</p>

<p>"Ah, great is the Manito," said the maiden,
"and his mighty name is feared by all living things
in the land. 'Great is the Manito,' says all the
world, and his fame has spread among the children
of the Great Spirit till they crouch with fear and
say: 'Mighty and cruel is the Manito! Terrible is
the Manito, and more cruel and cunning in his tortures
than the red men. His strength is greater
than the strength of the giant trees of the forest, for
does he not rend them with his mighty hands?'
But when I, the gentle maiden, walk forth, the trees
cover with many leaves the nakedness which thou,
the great Manito, hath caused; the birds sing in the
branches and build again the nests from which thou
drivest them; the animals seek their mates and rear
their young; the wind sings soft and pleasant music
to the ears of the red man, while his wives and
papooses sport in the warm sunshine near his
wigwam."</p>

<p>As the maiden spoke, the lodge grew warm and
bright, but the boasting Manito heeded it not, for
his head drooped forward on his breast, and he
slept.</p>

<p>Then the maiden passed her hands above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"> 45 </a></span>
Manito's head and he began to grow small. The
blue birds came and filled the trees about the lodge
and sang, while the rivers lifted up their waters
and boiled with freedom. Streams of water poured
from the Manito's mouth, and the garments that
covered his shrunken and vanishing form turned
into bright and glistening leaves.</p>

<p>Then the maiden knelt upon the ground and took
from her bosom most precious and beautiful rose-white
flowers. She hid them under the leaves all
about her, and as she breathed with love upon
them, said:</p>

<p>"I give to you, oh! precious jewels, all my virtues
and my sweetest breath, and men shall pluck
thee with bowed head and on bended knee."</p>

<p>Then the maiden moved over the plains, the hills
and the mountains. The birds and the winds sang
together in joyous chorus, while the flowers lifted
up their heads and greeted her with fragrance.</p>

<p>Wherever she stepped, and nowhere else, grows
the arbutus.</p>

</div>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">M</span>ANY hundred moons ago there dwelt
among the Senecas a maiden named
Tonadahwa, whom every young chief
coveted to grace his wigwam. One of
the young braves of her tribe had won her heart by
imperiling his life to save her from impending danger,
and to none other would she listen. Her
smiles were all for her hero, and her eyes lighted
like the sunbeams when he was near.</p>

<p>One day the maiden was urging her canoe swiftly
along the river, little thinking that great danger
awaited her and threatened her life and happiness.
Darting along the bank of the stream, unseen by
Tonadahwa, was a young Seneca warrior, who had
been a suitor for her hand, but whom she had
spurned and avoided. Her light canoe had borne
her far from the village of the Senecas, when she
suddenly heard what she supposed was the call of
her lover on the shore. Resting on her paddle,
Tonadahwa listened and again heard the welcome
call that deepened the rich color in her rounded
cheeks. Answering with a cry of joy, she headed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"> 48 </a></span>
the canoe toward the bank, and with a few
strokes sent it gliding underneath the overhanging
branches.</p>

<p>But it was not the form of Tonadahwa's lover
that sprang suddenly into the canoe. It was that
of the dark and angry rival, and she saw in his face
a look of evil triumph.</p>

<p>The maiden uttered no shriek, gave expression to
no surprise, though her eyes darkened and her
cheeks assumed a duskier hue. With an exclamation
that almost drove hope from Tonadahwa's heart, the
hated lover caught the paddle from her hands and
sent the light craft rapidly towards the middle of
the stream.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright object cleft the air and an arrow
sped from the bank of the river and buried itself between
the shoulders of the cowardly abductor as he
bent forward to clasp the shrinking maiden in his
arms. With a cry, the defeated rival leaped into
the river, hurling the paddle from him as he sprang,
and with his last remaining effort pushed the canoe
and its occupant far out into the rapid current. The
whirling, seething rapids caught the helpless craft
and bore it onward with terrific speed. Tonadahwa
waved a farewell to her lover, and, chanting her
death-song, which the pines along the shore caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"> 49 </a></span>
and whispered, the canoe went flying amid the mist
and spray of that roaring tide.</p>

<p>Green as the emerald, save where whipped into
white foam or enshrouded in mist, the river rushed
on, and the frail canoe, tossed as a plaything at the
sport of the current, was whirled onward until lost
in the roar and tumult of the impetuous flood.</p>

<p>Like the wind the despairing lover flew along
the shore to the high banks overlooking the falls.
There he paused a moment until the canoe and its
precious freight were lost to view. Then, raising
his arms a moment toward the Happy Hunting-Grounds,
he leaped into the fearful abyss.</p>

<p>But amid the pelting spray and beating flood appeared
myriads of shadowy forms&mdash;spirits of the
mighty braves who long before had found the land of
pleasant forests. Swiftly, yet gently, they lowered
the form of the hero until he stood unharmed beneath
the fall of roaring water, and received in his
arms the unconscious form of Tonadahwa, which
was held by the braves to await his coming.</p>

<p>Clinging to the broken rocks, buffeted and blinded
by the awful flood, the daring and triumphant
Seneca bore his loved burden to a place of safety
and watched with thankfulness her return to consciousness
and life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> 50 </a></span></p>

<p>The pine trees ever after gently murmured Tonadahwa's
song, and, mingled with the roar of waters,
listening lovers through all succeeding time can
often hear the strange, weird cry of Tonadahwa's
lover as he plunged headlong after the beloved
maiden.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">A</span>N old and honored chief went alone to
the top of a high mountain to meet
the Great Spirit. The chief told the
Great Spirit that the red men were
tired of the roots and herbs which, with the fruits
that grew on the trees and the bushes, made up their
food, and he asked the Father to send them some
of the food used in the Happy Hunting-Grounds.
The Great Spirit told the chief to take his wives and
papooses and go forth in the moon of rains and
stand on one of the plains, not moving from the
place where they stopped for the space of three
suns. Then the Great Spirit would come and give
the Indians food. The chief went back to his people
and told them what he had heard from the Great
Spirit. When the moon of rains came they did as
the chief had been directed. In three suns all had
fallen asleep. They were left undisturbed by the
Indians, for this peculiar manifestation was regarded
as a mark of especial favor. In a few weeks the
old chief and the members of his family had changed
into luxuriant green plants. The council assembled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"> 52 </a></span>
sent the wise men to visit the field, and what they
found there was corn.</p>

<p>Long and earnestly a young brave wooed a beautiful
maiden, and at last gained her consent to live
with him in his wigwam. But the days and nights
were lonely without her and the young brave could
not remain away from her lodge. Fearing that she
might be stolen by one of her many admirers, or
that danger might come to her, he slept at night in
the forest that he might be near to protect her. One
night he was awakened by a light footstep and,
starting up, saw his loved one stealing out of her
lodge as a sleep-walker. He pursued her, but, as
if fleeing in her dreams from a danger that threatened
her life, she ran from him, speeding through
the paths like the fleet-footed hare. On and on he
followed, and finally drew so near that he could
hear her quick breath and the rapid beating of her
heart. With all his remaining strength the lover
sprang forward and clasped the maiden's form to
his breast. What was his grief and astonishment
when he found that his arms clasped, not the maiden
he loved, but a strange plant the like of which he
had never seen before. The maiden had awakened
just as her lover overtook her, and had been so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"> 53 </a></span>
frightened at her surroundings that she was transformed.
She had raised her arms to her head just
as her lover caught her, and her uplifted hands were
changed into ears of corn, and where her fingers
caught her hair the maize bears beautiful silken
threads.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">T</span>HERE was a time when the days were
always of the same length, and it was
always summer. The red men lived
continually in the smile of the Great
Spirit, and they were happy. But there arose a
chief who was so powerful that he at last declared
himself mightier than the Great Spirit, and taught
his brothers to go forth to the plains and mock the
Great Spirit. They would call upon the Great Spirit
to come and fight with them, or would challenge
him to take away the crop of growing corn, or
drive the game from the woods; they would say he
was an unkind father to keep to himself and their
dead brothers the Happy Hunting-Grounds, where
the red men could hunt forever without weariness.
They laughed at their old men, who had feared for
so many moons to reproach the Great Spirit for his
unfair treatment of the Indians, who were compelled
to hunt and fish for game for their wives and children,
while their women had to plant the corn and
harvest it. "In the Happy Hunting-Grounds," they
said, "the Great Spirit feeds our brothers and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"> 56 </a></span>
wives and does not let any foes or dangers come
upon them, but here he lets us go hungry many
times. If he is as great as you have said, why does
he not take care of his children here?"</p>

<p>Then the Great Spirit told them he would turn
his smiling face away from them, so that they should
have no more light and warmth, and must build
fires in the forests if they would see.</p>

<p>But the red men laughed and taunted him, telling
him that he had followed one trail so long that he
could not get out of it, but would have to come
every day and give them light and heat. Then they
would dance and make faces at him and taunt him
with his helplessness.</p>

<p>In a few days the quick eyes of some of the red
men saw in the morning the face of the Great Spirit
appear where it was not wont to appear, but they
were silent, fearing the jibes of their brothers. Finally
duller eyes noticed the change, and alarm and
consternation spread among the people. Each day
brought less and less of the Great Spirit's smile and
his countenance was often hidden by dark clouds,
while terrible storms beat upon the frightened faces
turned in appeal toward the heavens. The strong
braves and warriors became as women; the old men
covered their heads with skins and starved in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"> 57 </a></span>
forests; while the women in their lodges crooned
the low, mournful wail of the death-song, and the
papooses crawled among the caves in the rocks
and mountains and died unheeded. Frosts and
snows came upon an unsheltered and stricken race,
and many of them perished.</p>

<p>Then the Great Spirit, who had almost removed
his face from the sight of the red men, had pity, and
told them he would come back. Day after day the
few that remained alive watched with joy the return
of the sun. They sang in praise of the approaching
summer, and once more hailed with thankfulness
the first blades of growing corn as it burst from the
ground. The Great Spirit told his children that
every year, as a punishment for the insults they had
given their Father, they should feel for a season the
might of the power they had mocked; and they
murmured not, but bowed their heads in meekness.</p>

<p>From the bodies of those who had perished of
cold and hunger sprang all manner of poisonous
plants, which spread themselves over the earth to
vex and endanger the lives of the Indians of all
generations; and in after years when any of the
Indians from any reason "ate of the fatal root," it
was said of them that they had "eaten of the bodies
of their brothers who had defied the Great Spirit."</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">A</span>N immense bird preyed upon the red
men in all parts of the country. Their
homes were at no time safe from its
ravages. Often it would carry away
children playing beside the wigwams, or, like a bolt
of lightning, dart from the sky and strike a woman
or man bleeding and dying to the earth. Whole
fields of corn had been destroyed in a single night
by its ravages, and its coming was so swift and
terrible that the Indians hardly dared stir from the
shelter of their houses. A strong party of Cayugas
and Onondagas finally determined upon its death,
no matter at what cost to themselves. A young
warrior offered himself for the sacrifice. He was
provided with a quantity of raw-hide thongs, and
repaired to one of the open spaces, where it was
believed the dreaded monster would discover and
descend upon him. The young brave was to bind
one of the thongs upon the bird's feet or upon some
portion of its body, if possible, before he killed
him, and then his companions, rushing from their
place of concealment, would try to slay the enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"> 60 </a></span>
that had been snared with such difficulty. The
preparations were elaborately made, and the young
brave went forth on his dangerous mission.
I Three days he sat, chanting his death-song and
awaiting the coming of his terrible fate. On the
morning of the fourth day the sky was suddenly
darkened and the watchers saw that the great bird
was slowly circling above the heroic young Cayuga.
He ceased his chanting, and, standing upright,
shouted defiance to the almost certain death that
awaited him.</p>

<p>With a scream that turned the hearts of the waiting
Indians cold with terror, the bird dropped upon
its victim like a panther on his prey. A short and
terrible struggle took place and then the concealed
warriors rushed forth to finish the work of their
brave young companion, who had succeeded in
throwing one of the thongs over the great mosquito's
neck. They brought willing and ready
hands to the battle, and the arrows poured upon
the struggling mass like a storm of hail. After a
long encounter the bird was killed, and the young
Cayuga smiled in triumph as his last glance rested
upon the dead body of the monster.</p>

<p>Runners were at once dispatched to the villages
to inform the Indians of the victory, and soon vast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"> 61 </a></span>
numbers of them came to look upon their long-dreaded
enemy that had been slain at such cost.
Its body was larger than that of the largest bear
they had ever seen, and the breadth of its outstretched
wings was as great as the height of three
men. Its talons were as long as arrows, and its
monstrous beak was lined with sharp teeth. There
was much rejoicing over the great mosquito's
death, and for several days feasting and dancing
were held in honor of the bravery of those who had
rid the country of such a terrible scourge. Soon,
however, swarms of the poisonous little flies that
have been the pests of all nations since that time,
infested the woods, and the Indians discovered that
they came from the body of the dead bird. Too
late they realized that the body of the great mosquito
should have been burned when it was first
slain, for fire is ever the destroyer of evil spirits.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">A </span>MAIDEN more beautiful than had ever
before been seen came into the house
of a great chief and grew to womanhood
by his fireside. All the tribes
within a distance of many long journeys paid her
homage, for, though her eyes were as dark as the
depths of the pool in the rocks, her skin was as fair
as that of the palefaces who came thousands of
years afterwards, and her hair was borrowed from
the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>The great chief was honored above all his people
on account of his beautiful daughter, for she could
work charms that drove away the evil spirits of
sickness, and when her father went to battle or followed
the chase he was ever successful, for he carried
with him the maiden's smiles to daze and blind
his enemies, or to aid in his search for the hidden
trail. Her songs were so full of music that when
she sang the wild birds were silent in the branches
of the trees, and listened that they might catch the
tones of her voice. When she laughed the waters
in the mountain streams sought the deep pools and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"> 64 </a></span>
for very shame stopped their noisy clamor. Her
feet were so small and delicate that only the skins
of fawns were used to make her moccasins. The
snow that lay over the earth in winter was no
whiter than her skin, and her cheeks were like the
first coming of the sun on the mornings when the
corn is ripe. Never before had the Indians seen one
so beautiful, and the wise men whispered that she
had been sent by the Great Spirit from the Happy
Hunting-Grounds to teach the Indians what beauties
awaited them when they had journeyed to their
long home.</p>

<p>Over all the land spread the story of this wondrous
maiden, like the tidings of a bountiful harvest
or the boastings of a successful chase. From the
villages far away came the young chiefs and warriors,
and when they had looked upon this lily of
the forest and heard the music of her voice they no
longer had hearts for the hunt, but spent their days
in trying to win approving glances from the dark
eyes of Oniata, the daughter of Tiogaughwa. They
brought for her the most gorgeous and elaborate
head-dresses of wampum, in which were woven the
quills and feathers of the birds their cunning had
been able to ensnare. They performed the most
wonderful feats of agility and endurance, often <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"> 65 </a></span>vying
with each other until even their rugged natures
could not withstand the terrible self-imposed ordeals,
and some sank exhausted or dying, while the
more fortunate ones shouted cries of triumph and
victory, loudly boasting of their own powers and
strength.</p>

<p>Tiogaughwa, the father of Oniata, was filled with
pride at the attention shown his daughter. His lodge
was rich with presents of rare furs and strings of
wampum that had been laid at her feet; the medicine
of the wisest chiefs was freely placed at his disposal;
he could have allied his tribe with the most powerful&mdash;for
the greatest chiefs and the most renowned
warriors sought to wed the beautiful Oniata.</p>

<p>But there came a change to these happy days of
the old chief, Tiogaughwa. One day the chiefs and
warriors were surprised to see the council-place
filled with the women and maidens from all the
country around. They deserted their lodges, left
the fires to the care of the old men and children,
and, without heeding the dark looks of their husbands,
sons or brothers, took the places usually
occupied by the wise men of the nation. When all
were assembled, the wives of five of the principal
chiefs were sent to ask Tiogaughwa and the chiefs
and wise men to come to the council-fires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"> 66 </a></span></p>

<p>When the chiefs and wise men were seated a
silence fell on the assemblage. At last it was
broken by the first faint notes of the mourning song
of an Indian maiden for a lover who had been slain
in battle. Others joined the chant and the weird
chorus was caught up by the hundreds of women
assembled, and filled the forests with notes of sorrow.
The song ceased, but its last note had
scarcely died away before another took its place.
The Indian wives commenced chanting the sorrowful
story it was the custom of a deserted wife to
sing in her lonely lodge when her husband had left
her to join another more congenial to his fancy.
When their complaint had ended, the women sat a
long time with bowed heads. Finally the wife of one
of the chiefs&mdash;a tall, lithe, beautiful young princess&mdash;stepped
before the chiefs and sachems and said:</p>

<p>"We have come to the council-fires, oh! my
brothers, that we might together tell the Great
Spirit that the lovers of the Indian maidens are dead,
and to ask him to meet them at the borders of the
Happy Hunting-Grounds. We have come, too, oh!
my brothers, to tell the Great Spirit that the bad
spirits have caught the ears of our husbands and
have told them tales that have led them from our
lodges, and their wives and papooses are sick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"> 67 </a></span>
with hunger. No longer is the smile of the dark
maiden sought by the young braves. She plaits
her hair with flowers and wampum and sits in the
forests to await the coming of her mate; but the
young braves come no more to woo her, nor can
they be found on the track of the bear or the panther.
They loll with the dogs in the shadow of
Oniata's wigwam and glare like the hard-wounded
boar at the dark maidens who approach them.
They are dead, and the hearts of the Indian maidens
are full of sorrow.</p>

<p>"The wives cover their heads with wolf skins
and tell the Great Spirit that their husbands have
deserted them. Day after day they have kept the
lodge fires burning, but the hunters come not to sit
in the light and tell the stories of the chase. The
feeble old men and boys have tried to follow the
hunt that they might provide the women with food.
The papooses have sickened and died, and the
death-song has been raised many times. But the
warriors come not. They have forgotten their
homes, as they lie in their camps near the lodge of
the white lily, where they are held in sleep by the
smiles of the Oniata.</p>

<p>"Have the dark maidens lost their beauty, that
their glances can never again bring life to the hearts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"> 68 </a></span>
of the young braves? Have the dark wives refused
to do the bidding of their husbands that they should
be deserted like sick and wounded dogs fallen in
the chase?</p>

<p>"My brothers, Waunopeta, the wife of Torwauquanda,
has spoken, and her sisters have told her
to say that if they no longer please the hearts of the
red men they ask to be sent on the long journey to
the Happy Hunting-Grounds."</p>

<p>As Waunopeta ceased speaking and took her
place among the crouching forms of the women,
there was a movement on the outer edge of the
circle, and in an instant Oniata stood in the centre
of the council-place. There was an exclamation of
interest as this vision of wonderful beauty burst
upon them. Many had never seen her, and they
were almost blinded by a loveliness that was previous
to that time unknown to the race. She was
clothed in the richest of skins, and her hair fell like
a cloud of sun-kissed mist over her beautiful shoulders.
Her cheeks burned with tints that betrayed
her common ancestry with her dark sisters whom
she had unwittingly troubled.</p>

<p>"Oniata is here!" she cried, as she looked around
at the dark faces before her, with eyes like those of
the hunted fawn. "Oniata is here to say that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"> 69 </a></span>
has not asked for the smiles of the young braves.
They came around her wigwam and drove away
the dream-god with their cries and love-songs; but
she covered her ears with the skins of the beaver
and would not listen to them. When Oniata went
forth to the forest they appeared before her like the
thunder clouds, and she went back to her wigwam
and could not look at her father, the sun. The
warriors came to the lodge of the white lily and
with shouts and cries told the Oniata that their
wives and children should be the white lily's slaves
if she would look out of her lodge upon them. But
the Oniata called the women of her wigwam about
her and they laughed in the faces of the warriors.
Oniata loves her sisters, but they are angry at the
white lily and ask that she be sent away to the long
home where she shall be seen no more by the braves
and warriors. She will go from the home of the
red men and her dark sisters&mdash;far away beyond the
mountains and the great lakes&mdash;and the braves will
return to life for the dark maidens and seek them
with love-songs in the forests, while the warriors
will once more go to their wigwams where their
wives and papooses await them. But her people
will remember the Oniata, for she will kiss the
flowers in the forests as she goes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"> 70 </a></span></p>

<p>"My sisters, the Oniata, daughter of the sun and
the great chief Tiogaughwa, has spoken."</p>

<p>She waved her hand, and the circle of listening
men and women parted that she might walk
through. The chief, Torwauquanda, started forward
to follow her, but the dark princess, Waunopeta,
stood in his pathway, and he knew by the
looks of the menacing faces about him that the
white lily would go alone.</p>

<p>Tiogaughwa rose as his daughter moved rapidly
away, and said: "Oniata has spoken well. She
will go in peace. The scalp-lock of the warrior
that follows her will hang in Tiogaughwa's
wigwam."</p>

<p>The old chief turned and folded his arms over his
breast, watching with pathetic love the fast disappearing
form of his daughter.</p>

<p>Out into the forest went the Oniata&mdash;the loved
of the sunshine, the dream of the Indian&mdash;and the
solemn council sat in silence as the beautiful vision
faded forever from their view.</p>

<p>Far away from her people she wandered, never
stopping to look back toward the home she had
loved. The sun warmed her pathway for many
days, and at night the sister of the sun smiled
through the branches of the trees and lighted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"> 71 </a></span>
forest so the Oniata would not miss her lodge-fire
as she slept. When she rested beside the clear
streams she caught to her bosom the blossoms that
covered the banks and breathed into their faces the
love she had borne for her dark sisters and her
home. The fragrance of her love filled their hearts
and from that time they have freely given their love
to others, as Oniata bade them when she pressed
them to her lips and kissed them in her loneliness.
When the clouds came and the rain fell, Oniata was
sheltered by the thick branches of the trees, and
when the rain had ceased she pulled the branches
down, and pressing her cheeks against them,
thanked them for their kindness. The trees learned
gentleness from the maiden, and their blossoms
have ever since spread their grateful perfume on
the air.</p>

<p>Many moons passed. The dark maidens were
again wooed by the young braves, and the wives
of the warriors were happy in the return of their
husbands. The winter came and cast its white
cloud over the land, and the frosts locked the rivers
in prison houses of ice. But Oniata came not to
the home of her people.</p>

<p>The great Tiogaughwa mourned his daughter in
his lonely wigwam, and his heart sang her death-song
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"> 72 </a></span>
as he sat before the fire-place, in which no fire
was lighted, and bowed his head in mournful
silence.</p>

<p>The warm winds came again, and the young
men and maidens were once more filling the forests
with their love-songs, while with laughter they
chanted the praises of their mates. Tiogaughwa
saw all this, but his heart was heavy and he had no
words for the council-fire, no strength for the chase.
He left his people and walked away in the path
that had been taken by Oniata. Wherever he
went the wild flowers raised their heads and told
him they had been kissed by Oniata, and the great
Tiogaughwa fell down beside them and caught the
fragrance of her breath. When the dew and the
rain were upon them he could see once more the
beauty of her eyes, and the gentle songs of the soft
winds through the trees that had sheltered Oniata
and had felt the loving touch of her caresses, told
the great Tiogaughwa that the light of his wigwam
awaited his coming in the long home.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">W</span>HEN the Great Spirit made the earth
and put the water in the deep valleys
to form lakes, and built the springs
in the mountains to form streams
and rivers, he did not give to the water the power
to show within its surface his children's faces
or to make the trees appear to grow with their
branches pointing deep into the ground. For many
thousands of summers the younger sister of the
sun was never seen far down in the bosom of the
lake at night, and many times young men grew old
and died before the sun could see himself in the
river, the warriors could put on their war-paint by
the deep pool in the woods, or the maidens plait
their braids with their smiling faces reflected from
the laughing stream that flowed beside the
wigwams.</p>

<p>The red men lived together peacefully and happily
then beside a great river. One day the young
hunters came home in haste from the chase and reported
the coming of many strange people from
beyond the river. They said the strange men carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"> 74 </a></span>
bows twice the height of the tallest chief
known in the peaceful tribes, or held in their hands
branches of trees to which were attached sharpened
stones of great size. The chiefs and wise men assembled,
and scouts and runners were sent forth to
see if the young hunters had not been deceived by
the evil spirits of the woods. But the young
hunters had not looked with double eyes, and the
strange warriors were as many as the pebbles on
the bank of the river. The hearts of the red men
were filled with fear, for they knew not then
how to fight against such numbers, and the
sachems arose from the council-fire and went forth
to the cave in the rocks where the Great Spirit
talked with them. The Great Spirit told his children
that he would care for them and protect them
from the strange warriors, and he told the people to
fear not, but to obey the three fathers and fire-keepers
of the nation. When the night came the
fathers told the men and women to build many
fires on the shore of the river, and when the fires
were built the red men were filled with fear to see
burning, deep down in the water, a fire for each
fire on the shore.</p>

<p>The strange warriors also saw these fires in the
water, and they were frightened and dared not cross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"> 75 </a></span>
the river in the night to destroy them. But with the
morning the strange warriors once more took courage
and plunged into the river to swim to the shore
where the children of the Great Spirit dwelt. Then
the Great Spirit loosed the spirits of the storm and
they rushed down the mountain and out upon the
river, and when he called them back the strange
warriors were not to be seen. Then the red men
went forth in their canoes and the water of the
river was clear and white. They looked down and
saw first their own faces and above them the smiling
face of the Great Spirit; and then, down deep
in the water, they saw the bodies of the strange
men who had come to destroy them.</p>

<p>The water never changed again, for the Great
Spirit saw it gave his children pleasure, and he
loved his children then.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">I</span>N the beginning, the birds were created
naked, but because of their ill-shaped
bodies and long legs they were ashamed
and remained in hiding. At that time
their throats had not been so arranged that they
could sing. A long time afterwards they learned
their music from the falling rain and the whistling
wind. But they could talk, and with loud voices
they bewailed their fate. Finally, with one accord,
they began to cry and shout as loud as they
could, asking that they be provided with coverings.
The Great Spirit thereupon sent them word
that their dresses were all ready, but that he
did not have time to come and see that they
were properly fitted. If they were in need of
their raiment they must either go or send to a
particular place a long way off, where they would
find the coverings.</p>

<p>A vote for a messenger was taken and the turkey
buzzard was chosen because he was so strong and
hardy. He started proudly on his mission, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"> 78 </a></span>
distance was so great that he became nearly famished
before reaching his destination, and, contrary
to his habits in those days, he was compelled to
eat carrion to sustain life. At last he came to the
appointed place and found the coverings ready. As
a reward for making the journey, the buzzard had
been given first choice of the garments. He at once
selected the most beautiful of the lot, but upon trying
it discovered that he could not fly well with so
many long feathers to manage, and so he laid the
dress aside and tried others. One he feared would
soil too easily; another was not warm enough to
satisfy his taste; a third was too light-colored and
would render him too conspicuous; a fourth was
composed of too many pieces and would require
too much of his time to care for it. So he went
from one to another, finding some fault with each,
until there was but one suit left the plainest of all.
As the buzzard had been expressly forbidden to try
on any of the coverings more than once, he had
but one choice left, and must either accept the
plain, homely, coarse suit he has since worn or go
naked.</p>

<p>Often when the birds hold councils in the woods
they talk quite sharply to the buzzard for his uncleanly
habits. He never fails to retort that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"> 79 </a></span>
ancestor acquired them while doing a great service
for others, and he closes the discussion by reminding
them that they have no special reason to be
vain, as he had choice of all the bird coverings and
took the one that pleased him best.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">T</span>HERE was a brave Indian many moons
before the white man came to the land
of his fathers who was the pride of all
the men of the east. Though he was
young, yet among his people his word was law
and his counsels were listened to by the older chiefs
with much attention. Three times had he done his
people service they could never forget. Once, the
great heron, that had preyed upon the children of
the tribe for a long time, had fallen pierced to the
heart by the arrow from his bow. He had gone
alone and unarmed many days' journey without
food to the mountain where dwelt the witches, and
brought from the medicine caves the roots that
cured his people of the plague. The third great
service was when he had led a band of warriors
against their enemies over the mountains and returned
victorious. But on this journey the young
warrior had seen a maiden whom he loved, and he
wanted her for his wigwam. The maiden dwelt
among the tribe that had felt the weight of the
young chief's blow, and the warfare between them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"> 82 </a></span>
prevented his buying her with the quills of the
wampum bird, as he could have done had she been
one of his own people. And yet, the young chief
thought, unless he could light his wigwam with
the brightness of the maiden's eyes, his heart
would no longer be brave and he could not lead
his young men to battle. For many moons he was
in hiding in the woods near the village of his foes,
patiently watching for the maiden whose eyes had
softened his heart. He sang the praises of his loved
one so often to the birds as he crouched near their
nests in the branches of the trees that they took up
his song and bore it with them in their flight over
I the plains and valleys. So often did the bear, the
fox and the beaver hear the praise of the maiden
murmured by the young chief in his sleep that they
thought the forests had brought forth a new flower
of more radiant beauty than any they had seen.</p>

<p>At last the young chief's vigils and waiting were
rewarded, for one day the maiden wandered into
the forest. With the calls of the song-birds and by
singing her praises he lured her far from her home,
and then he seized and bore her away toward the
hunting-grounds and village of his people. The
maiden had been watched by the jealous eyes of a
young brave who was her suitor, but he was cowardly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"> 83 </a></span>
and when he saw her borne swiftly away on
the shoulders of the dreaded chief, he dared not
follow, but ran swiftly back to the village to give
the alarm. The braves placed him in the hands of
the women because he was a coward, and started
quickly in pursuit of the girl and her captor. All
night they followed them over the rugged mountains
and through the dark forests. In the morning
they overtook them and were filled with rage when
they saw that the maiden was a willing captive, for
she had given her heart to the strong young chief,
knowing that he was brave and loved her. To
signify her willingness to go with him she had
plaited the braids of her hair about his neck, as was
the customary way among them to indicate a marriage.
Enraged at their foe for his daring and at
the girl for deserting her people, the pursuing warriors
killed them both on the spot and left their
bodies where they fell&mdash;the great braids of the
maiden's hair encircling her lover's neck.</p>

<p>From this spot sprang the violets; and the winds
and birds carried the seeds of the little flowers over
all the world, into all countries where men dare and
maidens love, so that the Indians of all ages might
know that the Great Spirit would always raise a
monument to true love and bravery.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TURTLE_CLAN" id="THE_TURTLE_CLAN">THE TURTLE CLAN</a></h2>


<div class="fig_left" style="width: 96px;">
<img src="images/dropcap_w2.png" width="96" height="98" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">T</span>HEN the Great Spirit created the turtles
he gave them a vast lake in and about
which they could reside, and where
they would never be molested by either
animals or people. But the turtles were not satisfied
with the shape of the lake, and found fault
with the hard, gravelly bottom and clear water.
So they set to work to bring all the mud they could
find on the plains surrounding it, and spread the
loads of loose soil over the bottom of the lake where
they were accustomed to lie. So many of them
carried on the work that the lake was finally filled
with the mud, and became so shallow that during
one particularly hot summer it was entirely dry.
Then the turtles held council and decided that the
only way left to them was to set out to find a place
where there was good water. One, a particularly
wise and intelligent old fellow, urged his brethren
to decide first upon some fixed course to follow
and then by all means to remain together. Said
he: "If we do this we will not only know exactly
where we are going, but we can help each other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"> 86 </a></span>
There are a great many of us, and if any foe attacks
us we can together repel the attack, for with our
stone backs and sharp jaws we are well equipped
for battle. Let me tell you, my brothers, that the
world is full of dangers, and unless we are banded
together and stand by each other, we will be scattered
and lose our standing as a nation."</p>

<p>To this wise counsel the turtles apparently
agreed, but each one wanted the honor of presenting
the plan that was to be followed, and each also
wanted the distinction of being chosen to lead his
fellows. The wise old turtle made every effort at
conciliation and proposed several plans, any one of
which if accepted would have made the turtles a
great and powerful nation, but they could come to
no agreement. At last the commotion became so
great that the voice of the wise turtle was drowned
in the clamor, and he was powerless to counsel his
fellows any further. Finally each turtle started off
by himself, bound to follow his own inclinations, as
the turtles have done ever since. At this foolish
course the wise turtle became very angry. "Fools!"
he cried, "I am ashamed to be counted as one of the
turtle race, and although in memory of the forefathers
whom I honor, I will always bear on my breast the
form of a turtle, henceforth I will not be a turtle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"> 87 </a></span></p>

<p>With a tremendous effort he threw the shell from
his back and leaped forth, a fully armed and painted
warrior. The turtles were terribly frightened and
made off as fast as they could. From that day they
have been wanderers.</p>

<p>The wise turtle became the progenitor of the
turtle clan. He taught his children to deliberate
carefully upon all matters of importance; to give
attention and careful consideration to the counsels
of their elders; and to work in unity in whatever
they undertook.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">N</span>EKUMONTA, the strongest and bravest
chief of the Mohawks, wandered alone
in silence through the primeval forest.
The giant pines looked down upon
him with frowns; the moss, dark and sodden on
the maples with rain, gave only a gloomy
greeting; the low beeches brushed against his
anxious face, and as he passed beneath them chilling
showers fell from their icy branches. Across
his path the snarling panther crept in sullen anger;
the frightened rabbit sped away to its nest under
the prostrate log; his brother the bear turned aside
and looked with sadness upon the troubled face of
Nekumonta as he hurried forward in the fast gathering
darkness. In all the forest no kindly sight came
to comfort the strong and brave chief of the Mohawks,
whose footsteps were heavy with fatigue
and whose heart was burdened with sorrow.</p>

<p>Through the cheerless, awful moons of snows
and frosts the plague had raged in the village of the
Mohawks. Many days and nights had the death-song
been chanted for men, and women, and children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"> 90 </a></span>
Few were untouched by the terrible sickness,
and the medicine men of the tribe had long
since seen the last of hoarded stores of herbs which
they used to put to flight the bad spirits. The
strong and brave Nekumonta and the light of his
wigwam, Shanewis, had watched the fires of life
go out many times. They knew that the Happy
Hunting-Grounds rang with the shouts and laughter
of their brothers and sisters; they sent them
messages by the echoing spirits and told them to
watch for their coming; but they were saddened
because their brothers and sisters had gone on the
long journey. The home of the Mohawks was full
of pleasure when the hunters and the women, the
young men, the maidens and the children worked
together in the fields of growing corn, or gathered
at night around the lodge-fire and listened to the
legends told by the aged.</p>

<p>At last the soft winds came, and their mellow
songs drove the cold and darkness from the valley.
With their first notes came hope&mdash;hope that when
the awful winter had gone to his home in the north
the plague would also take its flight from the
village.</p>

<p>Then Nekumonta's heart died, for Shanewis, the
light of his wigwam, was stricken, and from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"> 91 </a></span>
couch of furs smiled sadly as she whispered:
"Shanewis must fight with the bad spirits. She
would not leave Nekumonta, the strong and brave
one of the Mohawks, but her brothers and sisters
call to her from their long home."</p>

<p>For a moment Nekumonta stood erect, while
upon his face came the shadows of despair. As the
weary hunter loses control of his canoe and sees
below him the rapids that in terrible fury play
with their victim ere they hurl it over the precipice
of death; or, as the warrior who with rising hopes
has long withstood his foes, would see their reinforcements
come when his arm has lost its power,
so upon Nekumonta came the realization of the
struggle yet to come. But his brave heart failed
not, and bending over the shivering form of his
loved Shanewis, he said:</p>

<p>"Shanewis shall live. Let her fight the bad
spirits, and tell her brothers and sisters who call to
her that she cannot go to her long home for many
moons. Nekumonta has said it. He will find the
healing vines of the Great Spirit, and Shanewis
shall live."</p>

<p>The robe that covered the entrance of the lodge
was pushed aside, and the chief of the Mohawks
hurried away into the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"> 92 </a></span></p>

<p>In many places the snows were not melted. The
roots were locked in their beds by the frost, and the
medicine herbs had not yet awakened from their
sleep. Running through the open fields, looking
anxiously among the rocks, crawling under the
fallen trees, hurrying with despair over the barren
hills, swimming the swollen streams and rivers,
darting along the shores of the half-frozen lakes,
penetrating the gloom of the forbidding forests,
stopping neither for rest nor for food, Nekumonta
searched, repeating again and again, until the woods
and fields were burdened with the words: "Shanewis
shall live! Nekumonta will find the healing
vines of the Great Spirit, and Shanewis shall live!"</p>

<p>Three suns had passed since he left his lodge,
and still his weary quest was in vain. Wherever
he looked only dead leaves and withered vines were
to be found. When darkness came and he could
no longer see, the anxious searcher had, on his
hands and knees, crept onward all the night, hoping
that his keen scent would discover what his sight
had failed to disclose during the day. At the decline
of the third sun, stumbling forward in the
gathering darkness, Nekumonta fell exhausted to
the earth and the Great Spirit touched his eyes with
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"> 93 </a></span></p>

<p>Then the dream-god came and Nekumonta saw
Shanewis lying sleepless on her couch of furs and
heard her calling his name gently and with tenderness.
He saw that the plague ran through her
veins like the fires that swept the forest when the
rustling leaves lay thick upon the ground. Then
he saw her creep to the door of the lodge and push
aside the robe that shut out the cold winds. Long
and earnestly she looked into the darkness, calling
him to hasten to her side. He reached forward to
clasp her in his arms, and the vision faded. Now
he was in his canoe, which the taunting spirits of
the plague were pushing down the river, and they
laughed and shouted in derision as he tried to catch
the medicine plants that grew in great abundance
along the shores. Again, he was with his loved
Shanewis in the cornfields, filling the great baskets
with roasting ears to be taken to the fires where
danced and sang the red men in honor of the ripening
harvest. Then the voices of the singers changed
into low and murmuring sounds, which finally grew
more distinct until Nekumonta heard the words:</p>

<p>"Strong and brave chief of the Mohawks, we
are the healing waters of the Great Spirit. Take
us from our prison and thy loved Shanewis shall
live."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"> 94 </a></span></p>

<p>Starting from his slumbers like an arrow from the
bow, Nekumonta cast off the dream-god and stood
in the first light of the smiling face of the Great
Spirit as he came from his wigwam to open the
new day. Swiftly his glance darted from side to
side, searching in vain every tree and bush, every
rock and stone for evidence of the presence of some
one who could have uttered the words that had
come so distinctly that they must be more than the
echo of a dream. The practiced eye and ear of the
hunter could discover nothing unusual in the forest,
though every faculty was awake, every nerve
strung to its greatest tension. With sadness and
loss of hope his attitude relaxed, and with heavy
footsteps he turned toward the hills.</p>

<p>And yet he could not go away. Something sent
him back to the little opening in the forest, and
when he reached the spot where he had fallen in
the darkness the night before he bent suddenly and
placed his ear to the ground.</p>

<p>What caused Nekumonta to leap to his feet with
a cry of triumph that rang over the hills like the
shout of many warriors? What changed in an instant
the hopeless, dejected being who bent to the
earth, to a creature alert, with his hardened sinews
standing out upon his body in eagerness to expend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"> 95 </a></span>
its stifled strength? Faintly, yet distinctly, he had
again heard the murmuring voices:</p>

<p>"Strong and brave chief of the Mohawks, here
are the healing waters of the Great Spirit. Take us
from our prison and thy loved Shanewis shall live."</p>

<p>With a bound like that of the panther Nekumonta
sprang to the hillside, and from the trunk of a hardy
ash that had been felled by the lightning's bolt he
tore the toughened branches, bearing them in
triumph to the valley. Back he ran like the wind
and from the yielding soil dug armfuls of sharp-edged
stones, which he bore with hurrying steps
to the place where a promise had been opened to
him greater than the one of the Happy Hunting-Grounds.
Not a moment did he pause, but the cry
of "Shanewis! Shanewis! Shanewis!" was almost
constantly on his lips.</p>

<p>The smiling face of the Great Spirit rose higher
in the path it followed for the day, and looked
down over the hill tops at the toiling Nekumonta.
Forcing the toughened limbs of the ash tree deep
into the ground he wrested from their beds the
huge bowlders that impeded his progress and
formed the prison of the healing waters. With the
sharp-edged stones he cut the hard earth, and with
torn and bleeding hands he hurled the rough soil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"> 96 </a></span>
from the excavation. Like a very god incarnate
the dauntless spirit toiled&mdash;never resting, never
tiring, never stopping except at long intervals, when
he bent his ear to the earth. Each time he heard
the voices, swelling louder and louder, and repeating
over and over again the promise that lent him
an energy that could have torn the earth asunder
had it refused to yield its life-giving treasure for the
light of his wigwam.</p>

<p>When the smiling face of the Great Spirit had
reached the middle of its trail and turned once more
to the door of his great lodge, the tireless Nekumonta
leaped to the edge of the excavation with
renewed shouts of joy and triumph, and the woods
resounded with the laughter and songs proclaiming
that the imprisoning barrier had been broken open.
The sparkling, healing waters heard the welcome
voices in the woods, and rising from their dark
prison filled all the place the toiler had torn open in
the earth, and then ran merrily down the valley in
the sunlight.</p>

<p>Nekumonta bathed his bruised hands and burning
face in the grateful waters and then hurried away in
the forest. On and on he ran, with a step so light
that the dead leaves scarcely felt its touch, and
with a strength that laughed the wind to scorn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"> 97 </a></span>
His path was straight through the forest to the clay
banks where his people came in the moon of the
falling leaves and made the vessels in which they
cooked their corn and venison. Here his energy
was born anew, and with a skill that was marvelous
in its dexterity he fashioned a jar to contain
the healing waters. From its hiding place he
brought the fire stone, and the store of branches
collected by the old men and children at the last
moon of falling leaves furnished him a supply of
fuel. When the smiling face of the Great Spirit
entered the door of his wigwam in the west
Nekumonta took from the dying embers the perfected
result of his handiwork.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The warm winds, laden with hope and comfort,
stole gently through the forest and sang with gladness
of the death of winter. Life came once more
to the swaying branches of the trees, and the first
notes of the robins and blue birds thrilled the listening
air with a sweetness for which it had long
hungered. The second day of spring had dawned
on the home of the Mohawks the village where
the gaunt figure of the awful plague had reveled in
a dance of death throughout the weary moons of
winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"> 98 </a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a triumphant shout filled the air. The
hearts of weary watchers stood still with suspense,
fearing that the evil witches had once more returned
to taunt them of their helplessness. The plague-stricken
woke from their fitful sleep and called
piteously to the Manito. Once more the shout
arose&mdash;louder, clearer, more triumphant&mdash;a pealing
cry of victory from the strong and brave
Nekumonta.</p>

<p>Bearing aloft in his arms the vessel containing
the healing waters, Nekumonta burst from the
deeper gray of the forest like a flood of sunshine
and ran with steps as light as the warm winds
themselves to the darkened lodge of his loved
Shanewis. With the soft mosses he had caught
from the banks of the streams he soothed her
fevered form, and with draughts of the grateful
healing waters she was lured to returning health.</p>

<p>Thus the loved Shanewis came back from the
very borderland of the Happy Hunting-Grounds to
her home with the Mohawks.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/dropcap_t1.png" width="98" height="97" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">T</span>ROUBLE came to a village of the
Oneidas. From the north a band of
red men who had listened to the bad
spirits came upon the peaceful village,
and, with murder and plunder in their hearts,
spread destruction around them like the wild chase
of the forest fires. The homes of the Oneidas were
deserted and made desolate, and the women and
children were hurried away to the rocks and hills
for refuge and were guarded by the warriors. For
many days and nights the attacking party vainly
tried to find the trail of the people they had driven
from their homes. The Great Spirit had passed his
hands over the forest and the trail of the Oneidas
was not discovered by the savage Mingoes.</p>

<p>But the Oneidas were almost without food, and
over the tops of the trees and along the face of the
almost inaccessible cliff came hunger and death to
their hiding place. The warriors and sachems sat
long at the council, but their eyes were heavy and
they could find no path that would lead them from
their trouble. To try to escape from their refuge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"> 100 </a></span>
would expose them to capture and slavery at the
hands of their foes. To remain where they were
meant starvation and death.</p>

<p>Then the little maiden, Aliquipiso, came to the
warriors and sachems and told how the good spirits
had come to her sleeping under the trees, and had
shown her where from the side of the high bluff
on which her people were hiding huge rocks could
be rolled into the valley below in such a manner as
to strike down the very trees there. The good
spirits also told her to lead the foes of the Oneidas
to the spot and bade her go upon the mission that
she might deliver her people from their danger.
The warriors and sachems listened to the unfolding
of the plan with wonder, and when Aliquipiso had
finished, the chief brought forth rich strings of white
wampum and put them about her neck, saying
that she was the princess of all the nation and beloved
of the Great Spirit. When the night came
the little maiden left her people quietly and without
faltering, and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>In the morning watchful scouts of the Mingoes
found a little girl wandering as if lost in the forest.
They hurried away with her to the dismantled village
where she had been so happy with her fellows
and at once commenced to torture her, hoping to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"> 101 </a></span>
extort the secret of the hiding place of her people.
With a fortitude that won the admiration of her
captors, Aliquipiso resisted the torture for a long
time, but finally told the cruel tormentors that when
the darkness came she would lead them to the hiding
place of the Oneidas.</p>

<p>Night came again, and the exultant Mingoes
started on the trail they believed would lead them
to the camp of the Oneidas. Aliquipiso led the
way, but she was in the grasp of strong warriors
who were ready with poised weapons to take her
life at the first evidence of a betrayal. Through
many paths and windings, slowly and craftily, crept
the Mingoes until they were near the overhanging
precipice of granite. Then Aliquipiso signaled to
the warriors to come close around her, as though
she were about to roll back the huge mountain wall
and disclose to them those whom they pursued.
When they had crowded to her side she suddenly
lifted her voice in a piercing cry of warning&mdash;a signal
of death. She knew that above them the sleepless
sentries of the starving Oneidas were holding
great bowlders poised upon the brink of the
precipice.</p>

<p>Her captors had scarcely time to strike her lifeless
to the ground before the rocks rushed with terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"> 102 </a></span>
force down the side of the mountain, catching and
crushing the entrapped warriors like worms under
the foot of a mighty giant.</p>

<p>Aliquipiso, brave maiden of the Oneidas, was
mourned by her people many suns. The Great
Spirit changed her hair into woodbine, which the
red men called "running hairs," and sent it over
the earth as a protector to old trees. From her body
sprang the honeysuckle, which was known to the
Indians as "the blood of brave women."</p>

<h2><a name="WHY_THE_ANIMALS_DO_NOT_TALK" id="WHY_THE_ANIMALS_DO_NOT_TALK">WHY THE ANIMALS DO NOT TALK</a></h2>


<div class="fig_left" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/dropcap_i1.png" width="98" height="97" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">I</span>T was long ago, so long that the books
of the white men cannot tell the time,
that all the animals in the forest could
talk with the red men. There was a
time when the animals came to the great council-fires
and lent to the Indians the knowledge they
possessed of the woods and streams. The wise
beaver taught the Indian women and children
where to snare the pike and salmon, and how to
build houses that would keep out the rain and
frosts. The bear and the wolf led the braves out
on the plains and through the forests and imparted
to them their skill in following the trail. The dog,
by patient example, gave to the red men the tact
and power to watch for many suns without weariness.
From the raccoon the red men learned to
mount the trunks of the largest trees. The horse
consorted with the Indians on the plains and
showed them the secret of swift running. The
panther taught them how to conceal themselves in
the thicket, on the branches of an overhanging tree
or behind the ledge of rocks, and to rush forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"> 104 </a></span>
upon their enemies like the sudden burst of the
whirlwind.</p>

<p>Thus from every beast of the forest the red men
took lessons in the craft of the woods and plains,
and when they had finished all the other lessons,
the fox led them far away into the forest and taught
them the cunning necessary to make use of each.
In this way they lived while the summer and the
winter came many times, and they were happy.</p>

<p>But there came a time when the animals saw
that the red man was their master. He had the
wisdom of the beaver, the keen scent of the bear
and the wolf, the patience and fidelity of the dog,
the agility of the raccoon, the speed and endurance
of the horse, the spring of the panther and the cunning
of the fox.</p>

<p>Often the beaver would be surprised to find that
the Indian boys and women had not been content
with fishing in the places he had pointed out to
them, but had wandered away to streams which he
had hoped to keep for himself. Furthermore, they
were looking with envious eyes upon his warm
coat of fur, and he feared that they might want it
for a covering. Their houses were built with even
more skill than his own, and as they had learned to
fashion boats out of the trees he had felled for them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"> 105 </a></span>
and had made for their use paddles shaped like his
tail, they could dart across the lake or along the
river faster than he could ever hope to. And the
beaver was saddened because he had taught the
Indians wisdom.</p>

<p>The bear and the wolf, wandering in the woods,
often saw the Indians following the trail far into the
forest. At the same time the Indians so cunningly
disguised their own trail that the wolf howled with
anger when he tried to follow the red men, and the
bear grew surly and retired to his den in the rocks.
With the keen scent the bear had trained, the Indians
sought out the trees where the bees stored their
honey, and thus he was robbed of much of the food
he loved best. The wolf heard a young brave
promise a maiden that if she would live in
his wigwam she should rest on a couch made of
wolf skins and be covered with the warm fur of
the bear. So the wolf and the bear took their little
ones into dark caves and kept away from the
homes of the red men.</p>

<p>The dog, too, found that he no longer held first
honors for faithfulness at the watch. But he was
not angered at the knowledge that his brother could
rival him, but lay with him many nights on guard
in the wilderness, vying with him in vigilance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"> 106 </a></span>
When their long vigils were ended the dog and
the Indian would play together and make merry
with each other over the result of their friendly
contest.</p>

<p>The panther was jealous and raged through the
forests with fury. Sometimes, to his surprise and
wrath, when he had taken every precaution to conceal
himself from his brother, the red man, the
branches of the young trees would part as silently
as if swayed by the breath of summer, and between
them would appear his red brother, laughing at
him for hiding himself so ill.</p>

<p>When the raccoon reached the highest point to
which he dared climb, the Indian boys would follow
him with shouts of laughter, and go still further
toward the ends of the swaying and bending
branches, hanging from them in such a dangerous
and reckless manner that it made the old raccoon's
head turn dizzy, and he went away to the hills by
himself.</p>

<p>The Indians learned their lessons so thoroughly
of the horse and practiced them with so much
patience that finally that animal found he could no
longer play when they had races on the plains. But
he enjoyed the contests with his red brothers, and
when they returned to the village he would follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"> 107 </a></span>
and the Indian maidens would mount his back and
ride proudly to the council-fire.</p>

<p>The fox was greatly chagrined to find that his
cunning and tricks were matched on the part of his
red brothers with others equally shrewd. No matter
how carefully he concealed his trail&mdash;though he
walked in the beds of the streams or circled the
mountains till he had almost lost his own pathway&mdash;the
Indians would track him through all his
windings. When he tried to lead them astray by
subtle tales they laughed at his deceptions and put
him to shame before his friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that the Indians possessed the
knowledge of all the animals. They could follow
the trail with the scent of the bear or the wolf;
build more wisely than the beaver; climb more
daringly than the raccoon; watch more faithfully
than the dog; crouch more closely and spring more
surely than the panther; race the plains as swiftly
as the horse, and outwit the cunning of the fox.</p>

<p>Then the animals held a council, but the fire was
not lighted in its accustomed place and the red men
were in heavy slumbers while their brothers of the
forest talked.</p>

<p>The jealous wolf opened the discussion and declared
that when he had carefully looked on all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"> 108 </a></span>
sides of the existing state of affairs he saw but one
course for the animals to pursue. They ought to
rush in upon the villages and kill all the Indians and
their women and papooses.</p>

<p>The bear was more noble, and said that he thought
this proposition was unfair. He declared, however,
that the animals could not stand still any longer
and look without fear upon the dangers which confronted
them. It was their duty to challenge the
Indians to an open war.</p>

<p>The beaver argued that the better way would be
to wait till the chilling blasts should come and then
in the night tear away the houses the Indians had
built to protect themselves and their little ones from
the cold. The storms of winter, the beaver said,
would very soon put these smart fellows in a condition
that would make them anxious enough to
come to some terms advantageous to the animals.</p>

<p>The horse said it would not be right to cause the
Indians pain or death. The Indians were not bad
neighbors, though perhaps a trifle too apt and smart
for the rest of them. For a great many years, said
the horse, his ancestors and the red men had been
on the best of terms&mdash;not so much as a ripple of
trouble having disturbed their relations. He could
not for a moment think of entering into any plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"> 109 </a></span>
whereby he would be called upon to help take his
brother's life or cause him pain. He had heard that
away over beyond the great mountains there was a
pleasant country&mdash;not as pleasant and fertile as the
one in which they now lived, but a fairly good
place to live in. He would therefore propose that
the animals invite the Indians to go there on a great
harvest expedition, and when once the red men were
safely over the mountains the animals could steal
away in the night and return to their loved homes.
The panther scoffed at the horse for advancing
what he was pleased to call a silly and senseless
plan. The beaver, too, the panther said, was much
too leniently inclined. The Indians were to be
feared, and if the animals were to retain any of
their freedom and independence they must follow
the advice of the wolf. Only total extermination
of the Indian race could be depended upon to warrant
them from further molestation from the red
men. What good would it do, forsooth, to lure
the red men over the mountains and then run away
from them? Did the horse think the Indians sick
nurslings or women to lie down on the big plains
over the mountains and make no effort to return to
their loved streams, lakes and forests? Why, the
Indians would come back as quickly as could the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"> 110 </a></span>
horse himself, and then the very ground would be
made red with the blood of those who had decoyed
them away from homes that had for generations
been held in such high reverence by the Indians.
He advocated an immediate advance upon the villages
and would give quarter to none.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned toward the raccoon as he
rose to speak, for his was a very old family and had
long been held in high respect by all the inhabitants
of the forest. He said he could not exactly side
with the panther, for the Indians had never done
him any great harm. He was convinced, however,
that the country ought to be rid of them, for they
were becoming altogether too well skilled in the
craft of the woods. Too much power in the hands
of one individual, said the raccoon, was apt to make
it unpleasant for those with whom he lived. He
favored the plan advanced by the beaver. They
could lay their plans carefully, and in this manner
bring about a treaty that would keep the Indians
within proper bounds.</p>

<p>The fox felt sure that the better plan would be
for the animals to put themselves under his training.
He would teach them how to cheat and steal
while pretending friendship. They could then
easily strip the red men's fields of the corn that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"> 111 </a></span>
been planted for the winter. They could take from
their moorings on the river banks the boats and
fishing nets of bark and float them far away down
the stream where they would be lost in the rapids.
In this manner they could soon have the Indians at
their mercy and bring about a treaty on the plan
proposed by the beaver and seconded by the
raccoon. The plan, he continued, offered no danger
to them, as did the contests proposed by the
panther and the wolf; and he thought that mature
deliberation would convince all that it was the best
one to adopt.</p>

<p>The dog said that not until the present time had
he ever realized what it was to be a beast. He felt
ashamed to think he had been weak enough to be
prevailed upon to attend a council to which their
red brothers were not bidden. It was contrary to
the custom that had existed since the Great Spirit
first sent them to this fair and beautiful country.
He expected that they would all be punished for
such treachery, and indeed they ought to be. The
Indians had as yet treated them only with kindness
and respect. Many times in winter, when the
snows lay so deep on the ground that no food could
be found the Indians had opened their homes to the
animals who had not made suitable provision for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"> 112 </a></span>
food, and had fed them and kept them from perishing
with hunger. There had never been a time,
said the dog, as he looked around the circle of listeners
and waited for a denial of his assertion, when
any Indian had refused shelter, food or aid to a
needy, sick or suffering animal. To be sure the
Indians had acquired all the knowledge that the
animals possessed, but their doing this had in no
manner impoverished the animals. As they had
lost nothing by this, he saw no reason why they
should be jealous and fault-finding about it. Would
it not be far wiser for the animals to profit by the
example set by the Indians and teach each other
the various traits and characteristics each possessed
than to be consumed by jealousy and revenge, and
in the heat of passion break a peace that had existed
for so many years? He could not, and would not
be a party to any of the plans proposed, and if the
other animals persisted in following out any of
those cruel and treacherous schemes he should consider
it his duty to leave the council and go to the
village to warn his sleeping brothers of their danger.
More than that, he would fight on the side of the
red men if it became necessary, and help them defend
their lives and homes from the attack of any
force that might be brought against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"> 113 </a></span></p>

<p>When the dog had ceased speaking the wolf and
the panther were in a terrible rage. They accused
the dog of cowardice, bad faith, bribe-taking, desertion
and treachery. They said he had been made
foolish and silly by the praise that had been lavished
upon him by the Indian maidens. They reviled him
and stuck out their tongues at him for being lovesick
after the Indian women. They said he had
turned nurse for the papooses and hereafter would
better stay in the villages of his new-found friends
and lie in the sun with the old men. They dared
him to go to the village and expose the proceedings
of the council, saying that if he attempted it they
would set upon and kill him. "For a poor and
meagre crust of maize-cake, too hard for the teeth
of the red men to crush," said the panther; "you
have been bought, and you give up all claim to the
rights that have been held sacred by the dogs of all
times. We should think that the memory of your
forefathers and the long line of noble dogs who
have lived before you came on earth to disgrace
them would stir you to action for the honor of your
race."</p>

<p>"No," said the wolf; "he can remember nothing
but the soft caresses of the Indian girls upon his
head. I saw him the other day lying at the feet of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"> 114 </a></span>
Garewiis, the daughter of the chief Teganagen, and
when he raised his eyes and looked at her she took
his head in her arms and laid her cheek against him,
all the time stroking his back and singing to him as
she will sing to her papooses when they come to
her wigwam. Not only has he sold himself to be
the friend of the Indians and sit quietly by while
we are enslaved, but he is lovesick and his head is
turned."</p>

<p>This warm and intemperate language caused
much confusion and something of a sensation,
though the dog remained calm and dignified. He
showed by no outward sign that the uncivil and
untruthful charges of the panther and the wolf had
even been heard, much less heeded.</p>

<p>The horse instantly sprang into the open place
before the fire and hurled at the two false accusers
his most powerful eloquence. "I come as a
champion of my friend, the dog," he said. "You
have insulted and maligned him in a manner that
calls for the condemnation of all honorable beasts.
He is my brother. Because there is some difference
in our tastes and I am his superior in size, it makes
him none the less my brother. I love him, for he is
gentle, affectionate, trustworthy, noble and brave.
You, the panther, and you, the wolf, boast of your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"> 115 </a></span>
bravery; yet which of you dared rush into the
burning forests as did my brother, the dog, and lead
the blind doe to a place of safety? Which of you
dared plunge into the river, made deep and dangerous
by the melting snows as winter died and the
warm winds came to bury&mdash;him when the waters
boiled and foamed to the very tops of the high
banks and spread out over the plains like a great
lake&mdash;and from the midst of that angry flood bring
safely to the shore a weak and drowning companion
who had stumbled and fallen over the bank? I
have heretofore loved you all, but henceforth I shall
be ashamed to acknowledge the wolf and panther
as my brothers. They seem to think that bravery
consists in cruel attack and glistening teeth, but I
can tell them that it is more surely found in noble
deeds. I will follow the dog to the homes of the
red men, and together we will fight against the
cruel practices you design to put in force."</p>

<p>As the horse ceased speaking the Great Spirit
came suddenly to the council-fire and said that the
loud voices of the disputants had been borne to his
ears by the message-bearers and he had listened in
sorrow to all that had been said. He had therefore
left the Happy Hunting-Grounds and come to their
council. He was grieved that the pleasant relations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"> 116 </a></span>
heretofore existing between the Indians and the
animals would now have to be broken and disturbed.
When they had been given life the intention
was formed that eventually all would dwell
together in the Happy Hunting-Grounds. Now he
would be compelled to alter his plans. He would
change the language of his red children so that the
beasts could never talk with them again. He would
go to his children in the villages and tell them all
that had been said at this clandestine council in the
woods. For all time the wolf and panther should
be hunted and killed by the Indians. They should
be looked upon and warred against as the most
dangerous of foes. The bear might be counted as
an honorable antagonist, and the red men would
be ready to fight him in open battle whenever the
opportunity offered. The red men would not disturb
or molest him, but if he should come and demand
a battle the Indians would not refuse. The
beaver and raccoon, on account of the heartless
plan they had set forth for the vanquishing of their
brethren, should be considered the prey of the
Indian and should yield their thick furs to keep his
children warm. The fox would be looked upon as
a thief. He had proposed to steal the food of the
Indians and bring them to want; now he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"> 117 </a></span>
practice his desire. But the Indians would be
warned and would set traps and snares for him.
When caught his fur would be used like the fur of
the beaver and raccoon. The horse and the dog
might still retain their understanding of speech of I
the Indians, but as they had been guilty of breaking
an ancient treaty by attending a council to which
all the parties of the treaty had not been bidden,
they must receive some punishment, and would no
longer be permitted to speak the Indian language.
But they should always be the champions and
friends of the red men; they should live in the
Indians' homes, be present at the great feasts and
festivals, share the products of their hunt, be loved
and petted by the maidens and papooses, fight with
the Indians when they fought and be partakers and
sharers in the victories or defeats. In a word, they
should be the companions and brothers of the
Indians forever, here and in the Happy Hunting-Grounds.</p>

be awake and watching thy children, and they will
not know when thou art sleeping. Thy children
do not know the trail to the Happy Hunting-Grounds
by which to send their wise men and
sachems to talk with thee, for thou hast covered it
with thy hands and thy children cannot discover it.
How will the words of thy children reach thee, oh,
our Father, the Manito; how will what they say
come to thine ears?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"> 120 </a></span></p>

<p>Then the Great Spirit created for each one of the
red men a second self, to whom he gave a home in
the air. He provided these beings with wings and
swift feet so they could move very rapidly. To
them he imparted the secret of the entrance to his
home and made them guides to his children whom
he had called on the long journey so that they
should not lose the paths leading to their future
home. Finally, the Great Spirit told these creatures
of the air that they should be message-bearers for
his children, and convey their words exactly as
spoken from one point to another until they reached
the ears of his sachems in the big wigwam by the
side of the council-fire that never lost its light.
They must be ready at all times to answer the calls
of the red men, so that none of their words might
be lost. Messages to the loved ones who had left
the earth and gone to the Happy Hunting-Grounds
must be transmitted with the same watchful care as
were those intended for his ears alone. If any of
his children spoke idle and untruthful words they,
too, must be repeated that their father might know
whether they were worthy to be admitted to the
grand council-fire.</p>

<p>When he had finished his instructions, the Great
Spirit told the sachems that he would return to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"> 121 </a></span>
home and that they could go with his children to
the bank of a beautiful river near which they dwelt,
and there talk to him.</p>

<p>Slowly and with a loud voice, the chief sachem
began to speak. From the opposite bank of the
river the waiting message-bearer caught up the
sachem's words as they were spoken and with a
strong voice shouted them to another dweller of
the air who crouched in the tree-tops far down the
river, ready and alert to do the Great Spirit's bidding.
On and on, rolling along the ravines and
valleys, leaping from hill-top to mountain-side, and
from mountain-side to lake, striding over the forests
at a bound&mdash;fainter and yet fainter, until lost in the
blue distance of the plain&mdash;the message of thankfulness
and love was borne from the lips of the grateful
sachem until it reached the ears of the ever listening
and loving father, and was told to the chiefs
who sat in the light of the council-fire that never
grows dim.</p>

</div>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">A </span>LONG time before the white men
came, there lived a wise sachem who
was known as the Great Peacemaker.
His life was full of winters and
his mind was stored with the teachings of the
wisest sachems that had lived before him. He
could remember the time when all the red men
dwelt in peace, and before troubles came that drove
them to wars and dissensions. All his life was
spent in going from one village to another, teaching
the doctrine of peace among his people. He told
the red men how to help each other when the bad
spirits came and disturbed them. If the harvest
was poor in one village, he taught other villages
that they must take food to their brothers; if any
were in want, he said that those who had plenty
must relieve them. He settled differences and difficulties
by his logic, quelled wars and disturbances
by his wise counsels and eloquence, and taught
gentleness by his example. Finally, when he had
reached an age beyond that of any of the sachems
who had lived before him, he called his people together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"> 124 </a></span>
and told them that he must go away on the
long journey, but that they need not mourn for
him, as he would return in a form that would live
forever.</p>

<p>From his grave sprang the tobacco plant, and in
honor of his memory was established the custom of
smoking the pipe of peace at all peaceful councils.</p>

<p>When the curling smoke ascended around the
council-fires the red men saw in its fantastic shapes
the form and features of the Great Peacemaker.
They opened their ears and he told them that agreements
made in his presence were sacred, and if
violated would displease the Great Spirit. They
bent their heads and the wise sachem placed his
hands upon them as a token that he would aid his
children in all peaceful pursuits. His presence was
never invoked when there were discussions of
wars, for he would frown upon his children and
frighten them with his terrible countenance.</p>

<p>Many generations lived and died, and all respected
the agreements made in the presence of the wise
sachem's spirit, for not until years after, when the
red men had been taught the meaning of a broken
treaty through experience with the whites did they
ever violate a treaty that had been ratified by "the
pipe of peace."</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">T</span>HERE were many evil spirits and terrible
monsters that hid in the mountain
caves when the sun shone, but came
out to vex and plague the red men
when storms swept the earth or when there was
darkness in the forest. Among them was a flying
head which, when it rested upon the ground, was
higher than the tallest man. It was covered with a
thick coating of hair that shielded it from the stroke
of arrows. The face was very dark and angry,
filled with great wrinkles and horrid furrows.
Long black wings came out of its sides, and when it
rushed through the air mournful sounds assailed the
ears of the frightened men and women. On its
under side were two long, sharp claws, with which
it tore its food and attacked its victims.</p>

<p>The Flying Head came oftenest to frighten the
women and children. It came at night to the
homes of the widows and orphans, and beat its
angry wings upon the walls of their houses and
uttered fearful cries in an unknown tongue. Then
it went away, and in a few days death followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"> 126 </a></span>
and took one of the little family with him. The
maiden to whom the Flying Head appeared never
heard the words of a husband's wooing or the
prattle of a papoose, for a pestilence came upon her
and she soon sickened and died.</p>

<p>One night a widow sat alone in her cabin. From
a little fire burning near the door she frequently
drew roasted acorns and ate them for her evening
meal. She did not see the Flying Head grinning at
her from the doorway, for her eyes were deep in
the coals and her thoughts upon the scenes of happiness
in which she dwelt before her husband and
children had gone away to the long home.</p>

<p>The Flying Head stealthily reached forth one of
its long claws and snatched some of the coals of fire
and thrust them into its mouth for it thought that
these were what the woman was eating. With a
howl of pain it flew away, and the red men were
never afterwards troubled by its visits.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">T</span>HE ash tree, the leaves and bark of
which were the universal specific for
the poison of the rattlesnake, had its
origin in a warrior whose wife and two
children died from the bite of a rattlesnake that had
found its way into their wigwam. The brave's
grief was so violent that the Great Spirit gave him
permission to turn into a tree, the branches of
which would make bows and arrows with which
his people could kill their deadly enemies; the green
leaves placed in a circle around the sleeping warriors
would form a barrier through which the reptiles
would not crawl; the bruised leaves would act
as a poultice to draw the venom from the wound,
and from the bark could be brewed a draught that
would drive the delirium from the body of the
suffering victim.</p>

<p>A form of words was pronounced as the Indians
approached the ash tree to draw on its resources
for any of the purposes named. They would say:
"Oh, my brother, the mighty friend of the Indian,
your red brother comes to you for help. He has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"> 128 </a></span>
met the forked-tongue whose bite is like the sting
of bad arrows. He knows not where to turn except
to his noble brother, whose goodness is known
to all the Indians. Help me, my brother, for the
sting of the forked-tongue is deep and the eyes of
your brother close in sleep if you do not help him.
I wound you, my brother, but my fathers have told
me of your goodness and of your hatred of the
forked-tongue."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HUNTER" id="THE_HUNTER">THE HUNTER</a></h2>

<img src="images/dropcap_k1.png" width="98" height="95" alt="K" />
</div>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">K</span>ANISTAGIA, the hunter, was loved by
all the animals with gentle natures. He
never pursued them in wantonness,
and he took the life of none except in
case of stern necessity. To the wild, fierce monsters
that inhabited the forests and preyed upon the
weak and timid ones, Kanistagia was a constant
foe, and so swift was the flight of his arrow, so
powerful the blow of his hunting club, so unerring
his knowledge of their haunts in the mountains,
that they feared him deeply and hid away with low
and sullen mutterings when they heard his ringing
shout upon the chase.</p>

<p>These were the panther, the wolf, the wildcat,
and other strange and vicious animals at war with
the red men.</p>

<p>But it was not so with the bear, the beaver, the
raccoon, the elk, the red deer, the moose, the fox,
the squirrel and the dog. They were the friends of
Kanistagia, and when he walked abroad his path
was made bright by their greetings, and he often
sat a long time in their company and talked with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"> 130 </a></span>
them of curious things found in their haunts. He
treated them as friends and neighbors, and when
any were sick or wounded he gave them advice
about the medicine they should use that they might
recover.</p>

<p>Once when the corn was tasseled there came
fierce and warlike men from the north, and Kanistagia
and his brothers went forth to defend their
homes. The Great Spirit gave their arms strength
and the fierce men were driven away. But before
they went Kanistagia was struck upon the head by
the war club of one of the northern men, and when
the hunter fell to the ground his victor cut the scalp-lock
from his head and bore it away in triumph.</p>

<p>The hunters and warriors did not see Kanistagia
fall and mourned him as one who had been
taken a prisoner by the fierce men they had fought.
They knew he would meet death bravely and go
on his way to the Happy Hunting-Grounds with
smiles on his lips, and that the wrinkles of a coward
would find no place on his face. But his fall did
not escape the keen eyes of the fox, who ran to him
when the fighting men had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Alas! my benefactor and brother," lamented
the fox, "the heavy sleep has closed thine eyes
forever. Thy kindly life has been rudely torn from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"> 131 </a></span>
thy body before the death-song could warn thy
brethren of thy coming. Woe and sorrow will be
many days with thy brothers in the forest if, perchance,
none of them know the medicine that shall
bring thee from thy sleep."</p>

<p>Then the fox ran to the top of a high hill and
began to sing his death lament, that all might know
that trouble had come upon him. Through the
forest echoed the mournful sounds, and they were
caught up and repeated by the listening beasts on
hill and in valley until all had heard the tidings and
gathered at the place where the body of Kanistagia,
their brother, lay. When they had mourned over
his fate the bear called the council to silence.</p>

<p>Said the bear: "My brothers, we mourn for a
protector with whom we have spent many pleasant
seasons. By his wisdom and counsel we have
been taught many things that were good for us to
know. It is our duty now, if any know a powerful
charm that will awaken him, to produce it that we
may once more be gladdened by our brother's
smiles."</p>

<p>Then each one ran to and fro in the forest, bringing
many curious substances to the side of the
hunter, but none was of avail. The bear and the
fox, with plaintive whines, stretched themselves by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"> 132 </a></span>
his side and gently licked the wounds of their
brother, but their efforts brought forth no sign of
life. At last they were forced to believe that
Kanistagia must surely be lifeless, and a great cry
of mourning arose from the hundreds of animals
present. This attracted the attention of the long
nest (oriole) and he flew to ask its meaning. He
was informed by the deer, upon whose horns he
alighted, and after asking permission from the bear
to invite the birds to the mournful gathering, flew
rapidly away on his errand. Soon all the birds in
the forest had been told and the sky was darkened
by their flight to the scene of Kanistagia's death&mdash;so
wide was the fame of the hunter that all knew
him. Among them was the great eagle of the Iroquois,
which seldom approached nearer the earth
than the tops of the highest mountains. Slowly he
floated over the assembled birds and animals and
finally stilled his mighty wings and stood beside
the hunter. Then he spoke:</p>

<p>"Kanistagia will wake from his heavy sleep if
the sharp eyes of his friends will discover his scalp-lock
and their swift feet or tireless wings will bear
it to this place before the moon is round."</p>

<p>Forth upon their search ran the animals, the bear
and elk alone remaining beside their brother to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"> 133 </a></span>
guard his body from foes. Long and earnestly they
sought the trail of the warrior who had slain their
friend, but so carefully had he concealed his path
that none could follow it. The beaver sought traces
of his footsteps in the beds of streams; the dog and
the fox thrust their noses under the leaves and
deeply drew in their breaths, hoping to find the
scent of the murderer's footsteps; the raccoon
climbed to the tops of the highest trees and looked
in every direction; the red deer ran in great circles,
hoping to come suddenly upon the fugitive; the
squirrels, and even gentle rabbits, scampered in all
directions, looking in vain for traces of the slayer of
Kanistagia. But at last all returned, and with
heavy hearts told the council that they knew not
where to look.</p>

<p>The great eagle of the Iroquois bade the pigeon-hawk
make the first flight for the birds, as he was
swift of wing. Scarcely had he gone when he returned
again, but brought no tidings. The birds
murmured that his flight had been so swift that he
had not looked carefully, and the eagle sent forth
the white heron. But the heron was so slow of
wing that the patience of all was exhausted, and
soon some small birds came to the council with the
news that he had discovered a plain on which wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"> 134 </a></span>
beans grew in abundance and was now so overladen
with feeding on them that he could not rise
and fly. Then the crow came forward and said
that if he were sent he would pledge himself to
discover the hiding place of the murderer. So the
crow was sent and at once flew to a village where
he had many times been to watch for food. He
sailed slowly over the wigwams at a great height
and finally his keen eyes spied the coveted treasure.
Watching his chance, the crow dashed down and
caught the scalp-lock from the pole upon which it
hung, and rapidly winged his way back to the
council.</p>

<p>But when they attempted to place the scalp-lock
upon their brother's head they found that the piece
had been dried and would not fit, and they searched
long and faithfully for something that would make
it pliable. But their search was in vain, and in
despair they turned again to the great eagle, who
heard their plight and bade them listen to his words:</p>

<p>"The wings of the eagle are never furled. For
many thousand moons the dews of heaven have
fallen on my back as I rose to great heights above
the storm and watched my mate on her nest above
the clouds. These waters may have a virtue no
earthly fountain can possess."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"> 135 </a></span></p>

<p>Then the eagle plucked a feather from his breast
and dipped it in the glistening cup of dew that had
fallen on his back, and when this was applied to
the scalp-lock it at once became as when first
removed.</p>

<p>Again the animals ran into the forest, and from
every hidden place, from every deep ravine, from
tops of hills and mountains, from knoll and from
morass, brought leaves and blossoms and roots
from the rarest plants and trees. The birds sought
the cliffs and precipices where foot could not rest
and added to the collection many curious and rare
specimens. With these they made a healing medicine,
and when they had placed it upon the hunter's
head, his eyes were opened and he lived.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, there was rejoicing. The birds
beat their wings and sang loud choruses, while the
animals ran about in wild delight because their
brother had been awakened from his heavy slumber.
As the eagle of the Iroquois soared again to his
home on the mountain-top, the round moon, whose
coming all had so dreaded, rose over the waving
branches of the forest and lent its cheerful light to
the happy gathering.</p>

burns red and the shadows come and
go like mighty giants, and I will tell
you the story of Ta-ren-ya-wa-gon,
the holder of the heavens, who afterwards became
a mortal and was called Hiawatha, the wise man.</p>

<p>There came to his ears one day a great cry of
distress, and when he looked from the entrance of
the Happy Hunting-Grounds he saw a few men
and women in the forest moaning with terror, for
all their friends had been slain by mighty giants and
fierce monsters. So he went quickly to their aid,
and taking a little maiden by the hand, bade all
follow whither she led. By paths known only to
Ta-ren-ya-wa-gon, he conducted them to a cave
near the mouth of a river,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and there he brought
them food and bade them sleep.</p>

<p>When they had remained there many days Ta-ren-ya-wa-gon
again took the maiden by the hand
and led her toward the rising sun, and the few
people who had been saved by his mercy followed
gladly in the trail he pointed out. At last they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"> 138 </a></span>
came where the great river<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> they had followed
poured over some mighty rocks to the level of
another river,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and here he told them to build a
house in which they might dwell in peace. Many
moons they remained there in happiness, and the
little children who came to them grew to be strong
men and handsome women. Then came Ta-ren-ya-wa-gon
and said to them:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>"You, my children, must now go forth and
become mighty nations; and I will teach you the
mysteries of the forests and make your numbers like
the leaves that cover the trees when the warm days
have come."</p>

<p>Then they followed him toward the setting-sun,
and when they had gone some distance he told off
certain numbers and families that should make their
homes and build a village in that place. These he
gave corn, beans, squash, potatoes and tobacco, and
also dogs with which to hunt game, and named
them Te-ha-wro-gah.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> From that time they could
not understand their brothers, and they dwelt
henceforward on the banks of the beautiful river.</p>

<p>Then went he with the others towards the sun-setting
till at last they halted in a broad valley
where were beautiful streams. And he bade some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"> 139 </a></span>
of his followers remain there, and gave the same
good gifts he had given their brothers and told
them that they should be called Ne-ha-wre-ta-go,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
for the trees of the forest were of great size where
he bade them dwell, and in a short time these had
also learned to speak a new tongue.</p>

onward toward the sun-setting till they came to a
mountain which he called O-nun-da-ga-o-no-ga.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
There he again commanded some of his people to
remain, and he gave into their possession the same
gifts he had confided to the care of his other children,
and called them Se-uh-no-wah-ah-tah.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> To

shores of a lake named Go-yo-gah,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> he selected a

them build a village and left them provided with all
good things. These he called Sho-nea-na-we-to-wah;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>

<p>But there were some who were not content to
stay where the holder of the heavens had bidden
them to live and who ran away toward the setting-sun
many days until they came to a great river
which they crossed on a wild grape vine. But
when the last ones were crossing, the vine broke
and none could ever return.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Then the holder of the heavens gave his time to
the instruction of his children, and to each family he
imparted some distinctive skill. To the Senecas he
gave the power of swift feet, and they could soon
outrun any animal in the forest. The Cayugas became
skilled in the use of the canoe, and glided
over the waters more rapidly than the skimming
birds or darting fish. The Onondagas were instructed
in all the laws and wishes of the Great
Spirit and had power to speak his mind. The
Oneidas became skilful in ways of making weapons,
of the building of houses and the weaving of baskets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"> 141 </a></span>
The Mohawks were taught to shoot their arrows
with surer aim than all the others, and could snare
the fish from the streams with wondrous skill.</p>

<p>You, my children, must know that Ta-ren-ya-wa-gon,
the holder of the heavens, had power to
assume any shape, and that he could fly from one
place to another, far distant, more rapidly than the
great eagle. He taught his people the knowledge
of hunting and gardening; he fashioned arrow-heads
from the flint and guided the hands of his
children until they, too, could make them; he gave
instruction in the arts of war, that they might defend
themselves; he cleared their streams from obstructions
and pointed out the water path<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> from the
sun-rising to the sun-setting. He taught them the
form of poisonous fruits and plants, giving them to
eat of those that were wholesome; he taught them
how to kill and dress their game; made the forest
free for the tribes to hunt in, and gave them laws
and precepts to guide them in the treatment of both
the young and the old.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The "water path" was up the Mohawk River to Rome, over a short
portage to Wood Creek, thence to Oneida Lake, down the Oswegp River to
Seneca River, and thence westward over the chain of lakes in the interior of
the State of New York. If the journey was to be to the far west, the Oswego
River was taken to Lake Ontario and thence through the chain of great lakes.</p></div>

<p>Then Ta-ren-ya-wa-gon determined to reside
with his children, and he assumed the form of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"> 142 </a></span>
man and chose as a wife a maiden from the Onondagas.
When he had done this he was named
Hiawatha. His home was on the shores of a beautiful
lake,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and to it came many of the red men and
their wives and children, that they might learn from
the wise Hiawatha how their lives should be guided.
To his wigwam came also a daughter, whose
beauty was as the flowers, glistening with the dews
of night and kissed by the light of the Great Spirit's
smiling face. The name of the daughter was
Minnehaha.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Cross Lake, Cayuga County, New York. A very romantic and beautiful
point on the southern shores of this little body of water is pointed out by the
Indians as the site of Hiawatha's home.</p></div>

<p>Many seasons passed. Under the teachings of
Hiawatha the Onondagas became the greatest of all
nations. The wise man came in his magic canoe
of dazzling whiteness and sat at all their councils,
and by his wisdom and moderation the tribe was
preserved from strife and became foremost in the
arts and knowledge of the forest.</p>

<p>But at last there came an alarm from the north
beyond the great lakes, and the story was told with
fear at the lodge-fires of a relentless enemy who
came to kill and burn. In terror the chiefs told
their fears to Hiawatha and he advised them to call
a council of all the tribes at a place on the borders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"> 143 </a></span>
of a lake where he had once told them to light a
great council-fire, that they might make preparations
to meet their foes. Swift runners went to the
villages of all the tribes and the chiefs, and warriors
assembled at the appointed place. Three days they
awaited the coming of Hiawatha, and on the morning
of the fourth a mighty shout arose as they saw
his mystic canoe gliding over the waters of the lake.
In its prow sat the beautiful Minnehaha, while the
wise man, her father, occupied a seat at the stern of
the boat and with a light paddle directed the course
of the mysterious craft. He was met at the edge of
the water by the foremost men of the tribes, and
greeting them as brothers, each in their own language,
he stepped from the canoe and walked a
short distance along the shore. Suddenly a rushing
noise was heard, as of the coming of an awful
storm, and as all eyes turned upwards a great bird
was observed coming out of the heavens with the
speed of an arrow. Hiawatha and his daughter
alone stood unmoved and tranquil. The others fled
in terror. The celestial visitor alighted at the feet of
Hiawatha. Impelled by some unseen power, Minnehaha
knelt at her father's feet. He placed his
hands on her head for a moment and then she
slowly rose, cast one look into his face, murmured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"> 144 </a></span>
gently, "Farewell, my father!" and took her place
between the wings of the Great Spirit's messenger.
Instantly the giant bird stretched its wings for flight
over the glistening waters of the lake, and circling
over the heads of the appalled multitude, swiftly
bore its burden of loveliness to the home of the
Manito.</p>

<p>Hiawatha sank to the earth and covered his head
with the robe of a panther. Three times did the
smiling face of the Great Spirit pass across the
heavens before the wise man moved or uttered a
sound, and his red brothers feared he had gone on
the long journey and could not again give them
counsel. Finally he rose from his mourning, bathed
himself in the lake and asked that the council be
called. When all were seated in the place appointed,
Hiawatha came before them and said:</p>

<p>"My children, listen to the words of Hiawatha,
for they are the last he will speak to you. My
heart beats with yours, my children, but I cannot
longer remain to make known to you the will of
the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>"My children, the voice of strife has brought you
from the homes where you have so long dwelt in
peace. You tremble for the safety of your wives
and little ones; you fear that your happy life will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"> 145 </a></span>
be disturbed. You, the members of many tribes
and villages, have one common fear, and you
should therefore have one common interest.
Singly, no tribe can oppose the hordes of the
north that threaten to come like the storms of
winter, blasting and killing all in their path.
Divided you can make no progress. You must
unite as one common band of brothers. You must
have one voice, for many tongues make confusion.
You must have one fire, one pipe, one war club.
If your warriors unite they can defeat any enemy
and protect the safety of their homes.</p>

<p>"My children, listen, and Hiawatha will tell the
wampum of the Great Spirit."</p>

<p>He made a signal and the fire-keepers advanced
to the center of the council-place and united the
council-fires in one.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Then Hiawatha threw tobacco
upon this and said:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> See note on this legend.</p></div>

<p>"Onondaga, you are the people of the hills and
are warlike and mighty. Your strength is like
that of the great tree whose branches withstand
the storm because its roots sink deep into the
ground. You shall be the first nation.</p>

<p>"Oneida, you are the people who recline your
bodies against the everlasting stone that cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"> 146 </a></span>
moved.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> You shall be the second nation because
you give wise counsel.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Evidently an allusion to Trenton Falls chasm, located within the Oneidas'
Country.</p></div>

<p>"Seneca, you are the people who have habitation
at the foot of the great mountain and dwell
within the shadows of its crags. You shall be the
third nation because you are fleet of foot and are
greatly gifted in speech.</p>

<p>"Cayuga, you whose dwelling is in the dark
forest and whose home is everywhere because of
the swiftness of your canoes, you shall be the
fourth nation because of your superior cunning in
hunting.</p>

<p>"Mohawk, you are the people who live in the
open country and possess much wisdom. You
shall be the fifth nation because you understand
best the cultivation of corn and beans and the
building of cabins.</p>

<p>"Like the fingers on the hand of the warrior,
each must lend aid to the other and work in
unison. Then foes shall not disturb or subdue you.</p>

<p>"My children, these are the words of the Great
Spirit spoken to you by Hiawatha. Let them sink
deep into your hearts and be remembered. When
the sun comes again I will listen to your decision.
I have done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"> 147 </a></span></p>

<p>On the following day the council again assembled
and the wise men agreed that Hiawatha had
spoken well and that they would follow his teachings.
They asked him to be their chief sachem,
but he told them he could not as he was going
away. Then Hiawatha approached the spot where
the celestial bird had rested and gathered a quantity
of white plumes that had fallen from its wings.
These he gave to the warriors as emblems that they
should wear and by which they should be known
as members of the Ako-no-shu-ne, who were called
the Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Then Hiawatha said to them:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Succeeding generations wore feathers from the white heron, approaching
as nearly as possible the plumage of the celestial bird.</p></div>

<p>"To you, Oh! my children, remember well the
words of Hiawatha. To you, Oh! my friends and
brothers, be faithful in aiding each other when
danger may come. Recall the words of the Great
Spirit which have been given to you for many
moons. Do not admit to your councils the people
of other tribes, for they will plant among you the
seeds of jealousy and trouble and you will become
feeble and enslaved.</p>

<p>"Friends and brothers, these are the last words
you will hear from the lips of Hiawatha. Choose
the wisest maiden<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in your tribes, who shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"> 148 </a></span>
your peacemaker, and to your sachems shall come
wisdom to arrange for the reference to her of dissensions
that may arise among you. I have spoken,
and will now follow the call of the Great Spirit."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> See legend "The Peacemaker," and note on same.</p></div>

<p>At that moment sweet strains of music burst
upon the ears of the listening multitude like the
gentle voice of summer in the branches of the pine
trees; they heard it, but knew not whence it came.
The wise man stepped forward, and as he was
seated in the mystic canoe the music burst upon
the air in tones more beautiful than the red men
had ever before heard. But the snow-white canoe
did not skim the waters of the lake. Slowly it rose
as the choral chant pealed forth, and, following the
direction taken by the celestial bird, disappeared
among the summer clouds as the melody ceased.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">K</span>IENUKA, the peace-home, was desolate.
The fire of pine knots that for
many generations had burned upon
its fire-place was dead and sodden.
No voice of welcome was heard within its doors.
Its hangings of skins and robes were torn and
loosened by the winds of all seasons. The broad
paths leading from the sun-rising, the sun-setting,
the guide star and the summer land, which for
many hundred moons by night and by day had
been pressed by the feet of the red children of the
forest when in trouble, in danger, in need of counsel,
or in want, were now choked with briars and
thistles. The wolf whelped her young in the couch
of the Peacemaker. Birds without song and of
black plumage built their nests and muttered hoarse
croakings to their nestlings in the roof of the peace-home.</p>

<p>Blood had been shed in Kienuka and the Great
Spirit had made the peace-home desolate.</p>

<p>When Hiawatha, the wise man, was speaking
the last words to his children, he told them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"> 150 </a></span>
choose from their tribes a maiden possessing wisdom,
who should be their peacemaker. So the red
men built a home wherein the peacemaker should
dwell, and doors were made at each side so that it
mattered not whence came the wayfarer he would
find a welcome. Then the maidens of the tribes
were brought together at the council-place and to
them were submitted the questions in dispute
among their brothers. The wise men decided that
she who would decide the greatest number most
justly should be the Peacemaker Queen and dwell
within the fortress they had built. Thus the Queen
was chosen, and when the Great Spirit called her
to the long home she was mourned by the people
of all the tribes, and none entered the peace-home
until her successor had been selected.</p>

<p>In this manner came to the peace-home Genetaska,
the Seneca maiden, whose wisdom and
kindness were known to all, and whose beauty
was like that of the full summer. She was the
most famous of all the Peacemaker Queens, and
the red men said that Minnehaha, the daughter of
Hiawatha, came often from the sky on the back of
the celestial bird and gave her advice and guidance.
Whoever went to the doors of the peace-home disputing
came from them again, when they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"> 151 </a></span>
eaten and rested, with no anger in their hearts, for
Genetaska soothed them by her gentle voice. To
the sick and wounded she ministered with the
greatest medicine herbs; to those heated by passion
she told tales of the Great Spirit that taught them
moderation. Disputes among the tribes were so
adjusted that the hunters or warriors who would
come to Kienuka with anger and war in their
hearts left its doors as brothers.</p>

<p>One day there came to the peace-home two young
chiefs&mdash;one from the Oneidas and the other from
the Onondagas. Each claimed that his arrow had
given the death stroke to a mighty buck they had
been trailing in the forest. When they had tried
their skill with weapons, agreeing that the most
skillful should possess the slain animal, neither
could gain advantage over the other. Then said
the Onondaga: "I will fight thee, Oneida, and he
who lives may carry to his village the mighty buck
and the scalp-lock of his enemy."</p>

<p>But the Oneida said: "Thou, Onondaga, must
remember the words that have been spoken in
thine ears by the old men who listened to the
teachings of Hiawatha, that when two hunters of
the Five Nations dispute in the paths of the forest
they shall not fight, but tell their dispute to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"> 152 </a></span>
Peacemaker. The Oneida will go with thee to
Kienuka."</p>

<p>When they had eaten and rested at the peace-home,
the hunters were told that each should take
half of the buck back to his village. "For,"
said the Peacemaker, "the animal is large, and
with half each hath enough for his wife and little
ones."</p>

<p>"The Oneida is alone in his home," said the
chief. "I carry the meat to the old men and to the
women who have no sons. The Oneida has seen
no maiden he would take to his wigwam till he beheld
Genetaska, the Peace Queen."</p>

<p>Then said the Onondaga: "The home of the
Onondaga is desolate since the plague robbed it of
the loved ones. He is a great chief and has power
in his tribe, for he was never defeated on the chase
or in the contest. But the Peacemaker has made
his heart weak, and he can never be strong again
unless she will come to his wigwam."</p>

<p>Then said Genetaska: "Go, thou, my brothers,
and think no more of the Peace Queen, who is
chosen by the tribes and may not be the wife of
any. Seek thou other maidens, who will gladly
become wives to you."</p>

<p>But when they were gone there was no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"> 153 </a></span>
peace in the heart of Genetaska, for the form of the
Oneida was before her eyes.</p>

<p>When the autumn came&mdash;when its first tints had
touched the forests and merely tinged the dark
green with a hazy brown&mdash;the Oneida chief came
at sun-setting to the peace-home and stood boldly
before the Peacemaker. He said:</p>

<p>"The Oneida hath built a wigwam in the summer
land where the Five Tribes do not care to go.
He hath filled it with robes and supplied it with
food and it awaits the coming of Genetaska, the
Seneca maiden, who loves the Oneida. The tribes
will choose another Peace Queen when thou art
gone, and thy heart will no longer be heavy with
the burdens of all the red children who come to
thee with their troubles. Will not Genetaska go?"</p>

<p>The maiden looked boldly into the face of her
lover and answered: "Genetaska will go."</p>

<p>Toward the summer land they left Kienuka, and
when they came to the river they glided rapidly
along in the Oneida's canoe and were lost to their
people forever.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>But the peace-home was desolate, and to its
doors in the darkness came running two men
whose anger toward each other had long been fed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"> 154 </a></span>
with jealousy and hatred. When no Peacemaker
was found their rage could no longer be controlled,
and they fell upon each other with their hunting
clubs and fought till they sank from exhaustion
and died before each other's eyes.</p>

<p>The peace-home had been desecrated by the
shedding of blood. Henceforth it was a place
shunned by all men.</p>

</div>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">W</span>HEN the frosts were unlocked from the
hillsides there came into one of the
villages of the red men a mild and
quiet old man whom none of them had
ever seen before. He stood beside the field where
the young men played at their games, and when
some of the fathers approached to bid him welcome
to their village and wigwams they saw that his
body was covered with sores, and they made excuses
to turn aside that they might not meet him.
When none went to him and called him brother,
he turned to the village and walked slowly from
door to door of the wigwams. The women saw
him and as he approached their doors they covered
their children's faces that they might not see his
features, and wished in their hearts that he would
not enter. When the little man read their thoughts,
with saddened eyes and heavy steps he would turn
away and seek another habitation, where he would
again see that he was not welcome and turn his
weary footsteps from the door. When he had
visited all the wigwams in the village without finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"> 156 </a></span>
a welcome in any, he went suddenly to the
forest and they saw him no more.</p>

<p>The next day he appeared in another village,
where the same weary round of the day before
brought him no shelter. For many days thereafter he
went from village to village, and, though he spoke
to no one, he knew that their hearts were not open
to him and that they shuddered at his coming.</p>

<p>Finally there remained but two more villages to
visit and he feared that he should find none who
would bid him enter their homes that they might
minister to his wants. At last, however, as he approached
a humble cabin his eyes brightened, for
he read in the heart of the woman who saw him
coming that she had taken pity on his forlorn condition
and that her hospitality would overcome the
dread his appearance caused. Said the woman:</p>

<p>"Thou art welcome, my brother, for thou art a
stranger."</p>

<p>Then said the strange man: "Peace to my sister's
house and happiness to her husband."</p>

<p>Then the woman spread a couch of soft furs at
one side of the wigwam and bade the stranger lie
down; and when she had done so she asked him
how she should minister to his wants. Then the
strange man said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"> 157 </a></span></p>

<p>"Listen, my sister: Thou of all thy race hast
had in thy heart pity and love for a suffering and
friendless creature that have led thee to give him
shelter in thy house. Know then, my sister, that
thy name shall henceforth be great. Many wonders
shall be taught thee, and thy sons will be made
chiefs and thy daughters princesses. I am Quarara,
and bear messages from the Great Spirit."</p>

<p>Then Quarara described to the woman a plant
which she went forth into the forest and procured.
She returned to the hut and prepared it as he bade
her, and when it was administered to him he recovered
from his sickness and the sores left him.</p>

<p>Quarara remained at the woman's wigwam
many moons and brought upon himself all manner
of fevers, plagues and diseases, and for each one he
described the medicine root or herb that would
perform its cure. These the woman found in the
forest and brought to him, and he made it plain
how they should be prepared to do the will of the
Great Spirit and defeat the evil spirits and witches
that plagued his people.</p>

<p>Then said the strange man, Quarara, to her:</p>

<p>"Thou, Oh! sister, knowest now what the Great
Spirit would have thee teach his children freely.
Thou hast been patient and kind and thy heart is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"> 158 </a></span>
filled with gentleness. The sons that shall be born
to thee shall be called Sagawahs, the healers, and
thou and thy family shall be remembered throughout
all generations."</p>

<p>Quarara then brought upon himself the fatal
disease, for which there is no remedy, and returned
to his home with the Great Spirit.</p>

<p class="pmt2">The sun was commonly known as "the smiling
face of the Great Spirit," and when it disappeared
at night it was supposed to have entered the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"> 162 </a></span>
of a great wigwam which was built in the form of
a semi-circle. In the morning it reappeared at the
other door of the wigwam. Their ideas about
astronomy were extremely vague and were constantly
changing. The moon was believed to be a
sister of the sun, and in time would be able to give
as much light as her brother. The stars were
bright and glowing brands of fire tied with thongs
and held by spirits created for that purpose by the
Great Spirit. One star alone, the North Star, was
held by the Great Spirit himself because it was
always in the same place. It was called the guide.
Other stars and planets were named, but the names
have not been preserved.</p>


<p class="pmt2">The springs and the streams they formed were
first made for the convenience of the Great Spirit.
He desired to leave the Happy Hunting-Grounds
and make a journey over the earth and so he sent a
large white bird to carry water from the original
spring near the Great Spirit's wigwam and plant it
in the earth at convenient distances. Sections of
country that were without springs had not been
visited by the Great Spirit.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Language was looked upon as a sacred gift, and
was as much a part of the body as the head or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"> 163 </a></span>
limbs. For this reason an Indian never spoke the
language of another nation except in the capacity of
interpreter. When a council was held between
tribes the orators conducted the debate in their own
language, and the words were translated, when
necessary, as they fell from the lips of the speakers
by those who had been trained for that purpose.
It was considered the greatest possible affront to
their ancestors and to the Great Spirit for the Iroquois
to speak any language other than their own.
Deaf mutes among them were pointed out as people
who were not satisfied with the language of their
fathers and in consequence had lost the power to
speak or hear.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Difficulties and contentions were spirits of evil
that flew about inciting trouble. When disputes
and differences were arranged or settled they would
arise again unless buried. When terms of a settlement
had been agreed upon it was customary to
dig a hole in the ground, around which the disputants
would gather, and each party to the dispute
would talk his grievances into the excavation, absolutely
unburdening himself of all he had to say.
When the ceremony was concluded, the excavated
earth was returned and firmly stamped and pounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"> 164 </a></span>
down. In this way, it was believed, the quarrel
could be forever buried unless one of the parties to
the ceremony deliberately removed the earth and
again opened the prison of the bad spirits. From
this belief grew the custom of "burying the
hatchet" when peace was secured, and of digging
it up when war was determined upon.</p>


<p class="pmt2">The Aurora Borealis was believed to be the reflection
of the light of the camp-fires in the Happy
Hunting-Grounds. When its lights were seen it
was supposed that the brothers who had passed
into the future were rejoicing over the successful
termination of some great hunt or participating in a
feast. The size of a fire that could cast such wonderful
lights was beyond their comprehension, and
often the death-song of the warriors and chiefs
would refer to their hope of soon standing beside
the fire that was greater than the mountains. It
was customary for them to stand in the open air
and make long speeches to the spirits during the
time the Aurora was to be seen. They would chide
the spirits for wastefulness in building so large a
fire and call upon them not to burn all the forests of
the Great Spirit before their friends on the earth
were admitted to the charmed circle and permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"> 165 </a></span>
to enjoy the pleasures of a camp-fire of such
gigantic proportions.</p>


<p class="pmt2">It was wrong to complain of pain of any kind or
to show by any act that pain was experienced.
Both pain and suffering were caused by bad spirits,
and surely one would not give their enemies the
pleasure of knowing that their attempts had in any
manner caused discomfort. The Great Spirit was
trying with all his power to relieve those who suffered
pain, and to complain when your friend was
doing his best to aid you would make him think
that his efforts were not appreciated. Besides this,
after the first shock of a wound, none of the animals
betray by their cries the presence of pain.
The dog will carry a broken leg for days, wistfully
but uncomplainingly. The cat, stricken with club
or stone, or caught in some trap from which it gnaws
its way to freedom, crawls to some secret place
and bears its agony in silence. The wolf or bear,
caught in the pitfalls and pierced with scores of
stinging arrows, indicate by no outward sign that
they suffer. The wounded deer speeds to some
thick brake and in pitiful submission waits for
death. The eagle, struck by the arrow in mid-air,
fights to the last against the fatal summons. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"> 166 </a></span>
is no moan or sound of pain, and the defiant look
never fades from its eyes until the lids close over
them never to uncover again. The Indians learned
many of their lessons from the animals and were
taught to be as brave and uncomplaining as their
brothers of the forests.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">I</span>T is hardly possible to define the creed
of the people comprising the Iroquois,
for it was so intermingled with curious
superstitions of every kind that it cannot
be traced to a continuous doctrine like the religions
of other peoples. They had no special
teachers of religion, and the privilege of adding as
many superstitions as the mind could conceive was
possessed by each individual member. Thus their
religious belief was encumbered with almost every
superstition that could be created in the minds of
an ignorant and uncivilized people dwelling in wildernesses
filled with numerous wild beasts and
given over to the undisputed sway of solitude.</p>

<p>In a general way, however, according to the explanations
made by Cornplanter of the belief entertained
by him, their religion saw God as a great
and loving spirit whose extended arms bore up and
encircled the universe. They believed this Great
Spirit created all the objects, both animate and inanimate,
upon the earth; that he smiled upon his
people in sunshine and shower, and frowned upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"> 170 </a></span>
them in fierce storms and whirlwinds. He peopled
the air with millions of embodied spirits, some of
which were evil, and unless propitiated caused
pain, sickness, trouble and death. Others were
good spirits and aided the hunter in his chase, the
lover in his suit, and brought male offspring to the
mother's arms. Finally, he had prepared for them
a "Happy Hunting-Ground," where every one
should go after death. There beautiful birds would
make resonant the hills and valleys with their enchanting
song. The Great Spirit had covered that
vast and magnificent country with plains, and forests,
and limpid streams, in which and over which
would sport the red deer, bears, buffaloes, wild
horses and all animals and fishes useful for clothing
and food. The good Indian could there reside forever
with his wives and papooses, climbing the
rugged hills without weariness, sporting in the
rivers and lakes that never failed to supply an
abundance of fish&mdash;always returning from the
chase laden with the trophies of his skill. But the
bad Indian would return from the chase empty-handed;
he would lose his way and wander in the
labyrinth of beautiful paths that led him beside
fields of growing maize which disappeared when
he attempted to pluck the glistening ears. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"> 171 </a></span>
his more fortunate brothers would take pity upon
him and lead him to his home, and his punishment
would be the chagrin he would feel when of necessity
he was compelled to partake of his brother's
bounty.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the red men dwelt with the
Great Spirit in this delightful country, but they
were so boisterous and full of play that the Great
Spirit could get no rest on account of their noise.
Besides this, there were no evil spirits or dangers
there, and they could not learn to be brave and
courageous unless they were situated where they
came in contact with opposition and trouble. So
the Great Spirit made a large basket in which he
placed the red men, carefully covering them so
they could not see the trail by which he took them
from his home. He brought them to the earth and
left them with the promise that when they had acquired
bravery and circumspection they should
again be carried to his home and there dwell for
"so many moons that all the needles on the greatest
pine tree would not tell them all."</p>

<p>The Iroquois held sacred no day on which to
perform particular religious exercises, but they had
several annual festivals which were observed with
regularity for ages, and which are, in a measure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"> 172 </a></span>
celebrated by the so-called pagans among the
Senecas, Onondagas and Tuscaroras at the present
time. The first of these was the "Maple Dance,"
and exemplified their way of thanking the Great
Spirit for tempering the wind so that the snows
would disappear and the sweet waters would flow
from the sides of the maple trees that abounded in
the wilderness about their homes. Previous to
holding this, and all other festivals, the inhabitants
of each village would meet at the council-place for
what might be termed to-day "a confession of
sins"&mdash;for such it really was. When all had assembled,
one of the oldest sachems would stand
before his brethren with a string of white wampum
in his hands and tell wherein he had sinned according
to Indian ethics. When he had concluded, the
wampum would be passed to another, and so on
until all had unburdened themselves. The open
declaration of their misdeeds did not relieve them
of the consequences of the deeds themselves, but in
a measure it tempered the punishment. The moral
code may be briefly summed up as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was a sin to neglect the old in any manner, or
to refuse to share with them the fruits of the chase
or the products of the fields, and it was especially
sinful to neglect or disregard aged or infirm parents.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"> 173 </a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To speak in derision or slightingly of anyone
who might be lame, blind, idiotic, insane&mdash;crippled
in any manner or unfortunate in any degree, or to
refuse them aid or shelter.</p>

<p>To refuse to share food or shelter with anyone
who might apply for either, or to fail to care for the
sick and for orphan children and widows.</p>

<p>To break any treaty or agreement made at the
council-fire when the peace-pipe had been smoked,
or after the parties making the treaty had partaken
of food together.</p>

<p>To violate the chastity of any woman.</p>

<p>To kill animals for any other purpose than for
food and covering, and for the protection of growing
crops and human life.</p>

<p>To tell a falsehood, even though it might be of
the most innocent character.</p>

<p>To show cowardice in meeting any kind of
danger or to shrink from exposure, pain, suffering,
sickness or death.</p>

<p>To take human life unless the person killed was
a member of a tribe with which the Iroquois was
at war.</p></div>

<p>There were no punishments prescribed for breaking
any of these or other recognized laws, but the
person offending by the commission of the greater
sins was, by common consent and custom, shunned,
scorned, shamed, neglected, pointed at and ostracised
from all connection whatever with his tribe
and relatives. This generally resulted in the culprit's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"> 174 </a></span>
suicide, which was looked upon as a very
brave act, and was full reparation for the wrongs
committed.</p>

<p>Soon after the "Maple Dance" had been held
came the "Planting Festival," which was conducted
as a thank offering to the Great Spirit for
unfolding the buds upon the trees, decking the
woods and fields with flowers and warming the
earth so that it could receive and nourish the seed.</p>

<p>When the seed had been planted, and upon the
appearance of the first shoots of corn, the "Hope
Festival" was held. At this time, as the red men
circled around the glowing fires, they called upon
the Great Spirit to protect the seeds that he had
given life and asked him to bring them to maturity.
They sprinkled leaves of tobacco upon the fires and
repeated slow, monotonous chants or prayers that
had been used by them for unknown generations.
They asked the Great Spirit to give attention to
their words arising to him in the smoke and not to
let his ears become closed that he might not hear.
They said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thy children thank thee for the life thou hast
given the dead seeds. Give us a good season that
our crops may be plentiful. Continue to listen for
the smoke still rises. Preserve our old men among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"> 175 </a></span>
us and protect the young. Help us to celebrate
this festival as did our fathers.</p></div>

<p>The "Green Corn Festival" was held when the
season had so far advanced that the corn was
ready to be used as roasting ears. The old women
decided when this time had come, and none might
partake of the corn until the festival had proceeded
to the proper stage. This was a time of returning
to the Great Spirit their thanks for his goodness,
and the festivities lasted several days. They were
wild and uncouth, of course, but the participants
had faith that these ceremonies were pleasing to
the Great Spirit. The revelry was conducted in a
prescribed form that probably did not change for
centuries. In the midst of one of the dances peculiar
to the "Green Corn Festival" the oldest
sachem of the tribe gave utterance to a prayer of
thanksgiving, which has been translated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Great Spirit in the Happy Hunting-Grounds,
listen to our words. We have assembled to perform
a sacred duty as thou hast commanded and
which has been performed by our fathers since thou
taught them to observe this festival. We salute
thee with our thanks that thou hast caused our
supporters to yield abundant harvest.</p>

<p>Great Spirit, our words continue to flow towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"> 176 </a></span>
thee. Preserve us from all danger. Preserve our
aged men. Preserve our mothers. Preserve our
warriors. Preserve our children. Preserve our old
men that they may remember all that thou hast told
them. Preserve our young men and give them
strength to celebrate with pleasure thy sacred
festival.</p>

<p>Great Spirit, the council of thy people here assembled,
the men and women with many winters on
their heads, the strong warriors, the women and
children, unite their voices in thanksgiving to thee.</p></div>

<p>The "Harvest Festival" was held a few weeks
afterwards and was similar in character, though not
considered of so much importance as the "Green
Corn Festival."</p>

<p>Some time during the winter was held the "White
Dog Dance." This, however, was not of so
ancient an origin as the other festivals and was
probably a superstition promulgated by some of
the great "medicine men" within the last two
hundred and fifty years. Evil spirits that might
have been driven into the houses of the Indians by
the cold, were induced by various ceremonies to
enter the body of a white dog or gray fox that was
led from house to house for that purpose. Then,
with due ceremony, the animal was killed and the
bad spirits cremated with the body&mdash;the jaws having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"> 177 </a></span>
been tied together so that the spirits could not
escape through its mouth, into which they had
entered.</p>

<p>The Indians had numerous other ceremonial
dances and any number of social dances&mdash;more
than any other race of people, for they had few
other amusements&mdash;but those enumerated above
were the only strictly religious festivals. These
were in every sense reverential, devotional and inspired
by faith. The red men believed that if they
observed them according to ancient customs and
usages it would please the Great Spirit and that he
would eventually take them all to the Happy Hunting-Grounds.
While they clearly believed in an
immortal life and in the resurrection of the body,
they had no belief whatever in the infliction of
future punishment, other than that experienced by
the hunter whose arrows could not procure the
game he coveted and trailed in the land where
game abounded forever.</p>

<p>Had these people, possessing (as they most certainly
did) a religion combining so many of the
elements of the Christian religion, been discovered
by any one of the enlightened nations of the present
day instead of by the intolerant and greedy bigots
of four hundred years ago, their history would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"> 178 </a></span>
have been written with so many sad scenes for
illustrations.</p>

<p>About the year 1800 a new religion was revealed
to the members of the Iroquois then residing in
New York State, and as it is what is now known
as the Pagan belief, it may be well to describe it
briefly. At that time there was living on Cornplanter
Island, in the State of Pennsylvania, a half-brother
of Cornplanter and Blacksnake by a common
father&mdash;Abeel, the white trader. His name was
Handsome Lake (Ga-ne-o-di-yo), and he was born
near the site of the village of Avon, N. Y., in 1735,
and died in 1815 at Onondaga when on a pastoral
visit to that nation. His life had been spent mainly
in dissipation, and in his old age he fell ill and was
not expected to live from day to day. One night
he sent his daughter to summon his renowned
brothers to his bedside, as he was convinced that
his end was drawing near. His brothers reached
the house shortly after daylight and found Handsome
Lake at some distance from the hut, apparently
dead. They carried him in and had commenced
to make preparations for the funeral, when
suddenly he revived, sat upright and commenced
to talk very strangely. He recovered rapidly and
at his urgent request a council of his people was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"> 179 </a></span>
summoned to meet at Cornplanter, and to this assembly
he revealed all that had befallen him.</p>

<p>His revelations soon became the religion of the
Iroquois and may be considered their creed at the
present time. Handsome Lake journeyed from
tribe to tribe and taught the new faith till his
death, fifteen years after. He was regarded as a
second Hiawatha and had wonderful influence.
After his death other teachers took his place and
continued to expound the new faith as nearly as
possible in the exact words of him to whom it was
believed to have been first revealed. Unlike modern
theologians, they made no attempt to put their
views and ideas ahead of the original revelation, for
they commenced each new section of the long and
tedious recital with the words, "Thus said Handsome
Lake," and they followed him as closely as
possible, both in words and gestures. They did
not add to or take away&mdash;they simply repeated.
The last great follower of Handsome Lake was his
grandson (Sase-ha-wa), known to the whites as
Jimmy Johnson, who died about 1830. About the
middle of August, 1894, a grand council of the
chiefs was held at Onondaga, and on that occasion
these traditions were revived, several days being
spent in the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"> 180 </a></span></p>

<p>Stripped of long explanations as to how the message
was told and the details of the various provisions
and requirements, the creed of Handsome Lake
was as follows:</p>

<p>As he lay in his cabin looking out of the window
at the stars, momentarily expecting death, three
beautiful men came to his couch and gave him some
berries to eat, which threw him into a deep sleep.
When he awoke he was told by one of the men
that he might live if he would throughout the remainder
of his life be a teacher of his people and
speak to them the words that the Great Spirit put
into his mouth. He promised to do this and immediately
became strong. Then the men conducted
him to the outer air, where he was found by
his brothers, and, after showing him many wonderful
things concerning the Happy Hunting-Grounds,
again threw him into a sleep and disappeared.
When he taught he closed his eyes and
spoke only the words put into his mouth by the
Great Spirit; therefore, whatever he told them was
inspired. The doctrines expounded by him did
not displace any of the old ceremonies so dear to
the heart of the Iroquois. In fact, he urged the observance
of all the religious dances, saying they
were pleasing to the Creator. His first efforts were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"> 181 </a></span>
directed toward the eradication of intemperance,
and here entered the first threat of future punishment
in the creed of the Iroquois. A drunkard was
promised boiling hot liquor, which he must drink
in great quantities. When he had drunk until he
could hold no more, streams of fire would issue
from his mouth and he would be commanded to
sing as he had done on earth after drinking the fire-water.
Husbands and wives who had been quarrelsome
on earth were to be compelled to rage at
each other till their eyes and tongues ran out so far
they could neither see nor speak. A wife-beater
would be repeatedly led before a red-hot statue
which he would be told to strike as he struck his
wife upon earth, and when the blow fell, molten
sparks would fly from the image and burn his
arm to the bone. Lazy people were compelled
to till cornfields in a burning sun, and as fast
as the weeds were struck down they would again
spring up with renewed luxuriance. Those who
sold the lands of their people to the whites were
assigned to the task of removing a never-diminishing
pile of sand, one grain at a time, over a vast
distance.</p>

<p>These are but samples of the terrible punishments
to be dealt out to evil-doers of all kinds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"> 182 </a></span></p>

<p>At the same time he taught that rewards would
be freely bestowed to those who kept the laws laid
down by the Great Spirit, and into these laws as
revealed by Handsome Lake, with many fanciful
and poetical imaginings that pleased the simple
people to whom he taught, he wove the Ten Commandments.
He taught morality, temperance,
patience, forbearance, charity, forgiveness, and all
the cardinal virtues.</p>

<p>Handsome Lake implicitly believed that the vision
he described was a direct visitation from the
Creator, and he also believed that in his teachings
he was simply giving voice to the wishes of that
Creator. There is little doubt that he exerted a
decided influence for good, as did also his followers
for many years after his death; but when sects and
denominations commenced to tumble over each
other in their zeal to "Christianize the Iroquois,"
and hair-splitting questions of theology were put
forward to confuse and confound the teachings of
the prophet of their own blood, the Indians began
to doubt all that had been told them in the past
and their ears were stopped to all that might be
preached to them in the future. It may be truthfully
stated that few Indians have at present any
well-grounded religious belief, yet if they were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"> 183 </a></span>
fearful that it would cause them to be subjected to
further legal restrictions they would be well pleased
to return once more to the free enjoyment of
the teachings of Handsome Lake, their greatest
prophet.</p>

<p class="p02"><span class="hidden">I</span>N Forest Hill Cemetery, at Utica, New
York, a short distance from the entrance,
may be seen what is probably
the most interesting historical relic of
the Iroquois&mdash;the Sacred Stone of the Oneida Indians.
The legend connected with this monument
is as strange and poetic as any of those given in
the preceding pages, and quite naturally should
have a place in this volume. The story was obtained
from the Indians by the late William Tracy
before their removal to Green Bay, Wisconsin, and
as told by him and by contemporary writers is as
follows:</p>

<p>Two brothers and their families left the Onondagas
and erected their wigwams on the north
shore of the Oneida River, at the outlet of the lake
bearing that name. They kept the celebrations
commanded by the Great Spirit and he was pleased
with their obedience. One morning there appeared
at their resting place an oblong stone, unlike any of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"> 188 </a></span>
the rocks in the vicinity, and the Indians were told
that from it their name should be taken, and that it
would for all time be the altar around which their
councils and their festive and religious ceremonies
should take place, as it would follow them wherever
they should go. So they took the name of
"The People of the Upright Stone," and kept their
home beside this altar many years. But finally
they became so numerous that there was not room
for them here, and they builded their chief village
upon the south side of the lake, where a creek
bearing the same name discharges its waters. True
to the promise, and unassisted by human hands,
the sacred stone followed and located once more
in the midst of them.</p>

<p>Here the Oneidas flourished till the confederation
of the Iroquois was formed, and they became
second in the order of precedence in the confederacy.
After many years it was determined by the
chief men of the nation to remove their council-fire
to the summit of one of a chain of hills about twenty
miles distant&mdash;a commanding point before which is
spread a broad view of the fertile Stockbridge valley.
And when the council of the nation had
selected this new home for its people, the sacred
stone once more followed in the train of its children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"> 189 </a></span>
It rested in a grove of butternut trees, from beneath
whose branches the eye could look out upon a
landscape not equaled elsewhere in their national
domain. Here it remained to see the Iroquois increase
in power and importance until the name
struck terror to their foes from the Hudson to the
Father of Waters. Around this unhewn altar,
within its leafy temple was gathered all the wisdom
of the nation when measures affecting its welfare
were to be considered. Their eloquence, as effective
and beautiful as ever fell from Greek or Roman
lips, was poured forth upon the ears of the sons
and daughters of the forest. Logan, the white
man's friend, was there trained to utter words that
burned, and there Sconondoa, the last orator of his
race, the warrior chief and lowly Christian convert,
with matchless power swayed the hearts of his
countrymen; there the sacred rites were celebrated
at the return of each harvest moon and each new
year, when every son and daughter of the stone
came up like the Jewish tribes of old to join in the
national festivities.</p>

<p>This was the resting place of the stone when the
first news came that the paleface had come from
beyond the bitter waters. It remained to see him
penetrate the forest and come among its children a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"> 190 </a></span>
stranger; to see him welcomed by the red men to a
home, and then to see its red children shrink and
wither away until the white man's sons plowed
the fields beneath whose forest coverings slept
many generations.</p>

<p>At length the council-fire of the Oneidas was extinguished;
its people were scattered, and there
was no new resting place for them to which this
palladium might betake itself and again become
their altar. It was a stranger in the ancient home
of its children, an exile upon its own soil.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>It was known to several of the trustees of the
Forest Hill Cemetery Association that when the
Oneidas removed to Green Bay and broke up their
tribal relations they were very loath to leave their
altar unprotected, and when the association was
formed in the spring of 1849, correspondence was
had with some of the head men of the nation, and
consultations were held with the few remaining in
the vicinity of their old home. They were most
desirous that the stone should be protected, and
were happy in the prospect of its removal to some
place where it would remain secure from the contingencies
and dangers to which it might be exposed
in a private holding, liable to constant change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"> 191 </a></span>
of owners. With the consent of the owner of the
farm upon which it was located, the huge boulder
was carefully loaded upon a wagon drawn by four
horses, and in the autumn of 1849, accompanied by
a delegation of Oneida Indians and two of the
trustees of the cemetery association, it was conveyed
with considerable difficulty to its present site. It is
said by some who remember the occasion, that before
the Indians departed from the cemetery, they
assembled around the stone and betrayed in their
leave-taking pitiful manifestations of grief, several
of them kneeling beside the boulder and kissing
it.</p>

<p>Here this mass of white granite, which is unlike
any of the stones or rocks to be found south of the
northern dip of the Adirondacks, or the granite hills
of Vermont and New Hampshire, remained on a
grassy mound a half century. Its weight is estimated
to be about four thousand pounds. In the
spring of 1902 the cemetery authorities caused it to
be placed upon a base of Westerly marble, upon
one side of which is fixed a bronze tablet bearing
this inscription:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Confederation of the Iroquois</span>, Page 23.&mdash;When the
Europeans discovered North America they found that portion of the
continent lying east of a line about as far west as the city of
Cleveland, Ohio, and from the great lakes on the north to the
Chesapeake Bay on the south, practically under the control of a
confederacy of tribes, to which the French in after years applied the
term Iroquois, and which the English called the Five Nations.
This confederacy was composed of the Senecas, Mohawks, Onondagas,
Oneidas and Cayugas. In the year 1712 the Tuscaroras, a
tribe previously located in North Carolina, were defeated in a war
with their white neighbors, and about one thousand eight hundred
of them fled to what is now New York State, then the actual
dwelling-place of most of the Iroquois, and were adopted into the
confederacy. The new tribe did not possess the energy and courage
of their associates, and for several years after their coming the
men wore the tobacco pouches of the women, thus acknowledging
upon all occasions that they were inferior to the other five nations
comprising the union which had become their protectors. After
the coming of the Tuscaroras the confederacy was known as the
Six Nations of Indians&mdash;a designation which is often used at the
present time in law in matters pertaining to the Indians of New
York State.</p>

<p>The date of the formation of this confederacy has never been
settled with any degree of certainty, and all attempts have ended
in mere conjecture and speculation. The most authentic tradition
heretofore published places the date about the year 1589, but there
is no positive proof that this date is accurate. The legend of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"> 198 </a></span>
formation here published is not only based upon what was considered
reliable authority by Cornplanter, but has also the sanction
of that other noted Seneca chief, Governor Blacksnake (the Nephew),
who was contemporaneous with Cornplanter, and who was probably
born about the year 1736 and died in 1859, at the supposed
age of one hundred and twenty-three years. These chiefs both
claimed to have seen a string of wampum in their early years that
placed the formation of the confederacy at a time when there
occurred a total eclipse of the sun&mdash;"a darkening of the Great
Spirit's smiling face"&mdash;that took place when the corn was receiving
its last tillage, long before events that could be reliably ascribed to
the year 1540.</p>

<p>At this point it will be well to say that the Indians possessed
strings of wampum which actually recorded historical events. They
were made upon the skins of some animal and were formed of
small pieces of bone, variously shaped and colored, small stones,
and a variety of small shells, quills and sometimes the teeth or
claws of animals. These were strung upon the tanned skin by
piercing holes through them and tying them securely with sinews.
Certain ones in the tribe were selected as keepers of the wampum
and it was their duty to store all necessary facts in their memory
and associate with them the successive lines and arrangement of the
stones, shells, quills, etc., so that they could be readily called to
mind. At general councils these records were brought before the
people and solemnly expounded. As these people possessed remarkable
memories, the meaning of the wampum string was
accurately carried down from generation to generation.</p>

<p>The place of holding the council that formed the confederacy has
also been the subject of some dispute, but it is pretty certain that
it was near the northern end of either Seneca or Cayuga Lake, and
that it took place in that year previous to 1540 in which occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"> 199 </a></span>
an eclipse of the sun in the month when the corn receives its last
tilling.</p>

<p>Professor Lewis Swift, of the Warner Observatory, Rochester,
kindly furnished the following table of dates:</p>

<table style="width: 16em;" summary="eclipses">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Annular Eclipse</td>
  <td class="tdr">October 11, 1520</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Annular Eclipse</td>
  <td class="tdr">May 8, 1491</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Total Eclipse</td>
  <td class="tdr">July 29, 1478</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Total Eclipse</td>
  <td class="tdr">June 28, 1451</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Annular Eclipse</td>
  <td class="tdr">April 26, 1427</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The first given, October, 1520, is out of the question, as the
corn would have been harvested at that time of year.</p>

<p>The second, May, 1491, would have been too early in the season
to comply with the conditions of the wampum record, for the corn
would hardly have made its appearance above the ground as early
as the 8th of May.</p>

<p>The third, the last of July, 1478, will not answer the account
given, for the ears of the maize would have been forming at that
time and the plant would have passed its period of tillage.</p>

<p>The fourth date, June 28, 1451, must, therefore, have been the
one upon which the confederation took place, as at that time of
the year the corn in Central New York Is about ready for its final
tilling.</p>

<p>Upon the authority of these two chiefs it is not difficult to believe
that this date is historically correct and that the incident related in
the legend was the occasion upon which this wonderful union of
republics was formed. Considered as a government formed by a
savage people, the confederation of the Iroquois certainly was a
wonderful union. Had it not been broken and destroyed by the
whites after a series of wars extending over two centuries and culminating
in the great village-burning expedition of Sullivan in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"> 200 </a></span>
1779, this confederacy would have made rapid progress in
civilization.</p>

<p>Among the Five Nations alone can be found the Indian of the
novelist and poet. The Iroquois stand out and above all other
aboriginal inhabitants in their intelligence, their oratory, their friendship
and their character. Had they been treated with fairness;
had they not been made the subjects of the most cruel wrongs and
deceptions; had they not been driven to retaliation and finally to
relentless slaughter, the pages of our histories would doubtless have
recorded of this people achievements of which any nation might be
proud.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Legend of the River</span>, Page 47.&mdash;This story was told of the
Genesee River and Falls, and is occasionally heard among the older
Senecas at the present time. It is said that one family of the Senecas
were very much opposed to signing the treaty that surrendered
the territory surrounding the scene of this legend. They claimed
to be descendants of Tonadahwa and her brave rescuer, and believed
that the spirits of their dead ancestors often visited the scene
of their adventure and upon this spot plighted anew their troth.
There is little doubt that this story, in the main, is true, and that a
young Indian and a maiden, whom he was trying to rescue from a
warrior of another tribe, were almost miraculously preserved alive
after being carried over the Genesee Falls in a canoe. This legend
has been put forth in various ways, one of which was that the
Indians living near Niagara Falls were accustomed to sacrifice annually
to the spirit of the Falls by sending the fairest maiden of the
tribe over the precipice in a white birch canoe, decked with fruits
and flowers. Frequently male relatives or lovers are said to have
accompanied or followed victims who were set apart for this sacrifice.
If this is so it must have been a practice of some other tribe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"> 201 </a></span>
than those composing the Iroquois, for the Iroquoian tribes did not
practice customs which called for the sacrifice of human life, unless
the sacrifice was self-imposed.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Legends of the Corn</span>, Page 51.&mdash;Corn, or maize, was the
chief food of the Indians and consequently there were many legends
concerning its origin. The two here given were looked upon as the
oldest. The Indians had a firm belief that it was possible to change
one's form, unless the one desiring the change was unfortunate
enough to be under the influence of some evil spirit that out of
malice prevented the transformation. The Indian women were
especially proud of the legend attributing the origin of the maize to
the frightened maiden fleeing from her lover, and it was told to
their daughters very often and with many extravagant embellishments.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The First Winter</span>, Page 55.&mdash;The Indians were taught never
to speak ill of any of the celestial bodies or of the works of nature.
They must never complain of the glare and heat of the sun, lest
they be stricken blind; nor must they complain of the clouds for
fear that they might be shut up in caves in the mountains where no
light could enter. The moon must be treated with the same respect
and consideration, for those who said aught against her were
in imminent danger of death by a fall of rocks from the sky. The
most severe storms of wind, snow, frost or hail must be treated
only with great respect. Those who complained about them were
by this act unarmed and could not resist their attacks and rigors.
In fact, they were taught to "take the bitter with the sweet"
without making wry faces. This training through long generations
rendered the race cold and stoical, apparently indifferent to suffering.
They probably suffered the same as others, but they bore it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"> 202 </a></span>
without a sign. This legend was a very common one and was
frequently told the young in order that the lesson might be deeply
impressed upon them that they should never set themselves up in
opposition to the Great Spirit or complain of the enforcement of
his laws.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Story of Oniata</span>, Page 63.&mdash;Cornplanter held that there
were many traditions among the Indians that in one way or another
mentioned persons who were described as white; and this, too,
long before the coming of the Europeans. One tradition was to
the effect that thousands of years ago, away off to the southwest,
there was a tribe of Indians in which were born several children
who were made "like the Great Spirit, with faces as the sun."
They were said to be very proud of the distinction and also to have
been great warriors. They were believed to have wandered to the
south and finally to have been lost in the mountains. After the
coming of the Europeans this tradition was revived, and the ever-ready
imagination of the Indians added a sequel to the disappearance
of the "white Indians." They said the whites had gone
across the bitter lake (the ocean) and founded the nations of the
palefaces and were now returning to conquer and subdue their
forefathers. It was Cornplanter's belief that this was the older
continent and that the Indian was nearest the original creation. He
did not believe these traditional white people were as white as the
English. They possessed all the Indian features, he said, but had
light-colored skins and light hair.</p>

<p>Since this volume was made ready for publication the author
found in a Western newspaper an account of the return from New
Mexico of a Mr. Williamson, who had been spending some months
in an out-of-the-way place in that territory among the Moqui
Indians. Mr. Williamson told an interesting story about a family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"> 203 </a></span>
of that tribe the members of which are white. He saw these
people and asserts there is no doubt as to their color. He also says
they are without doubt pure Indians and that they have none of
the characteristics of the Albinos often seen among the Negroes.
The family is known far and wide among the Indians themselves,
but as their place of residence is some distance from the usual routes
traveled by white men, they are rarely seen by others than the race
to which they belong. The Indians look upon them as something
holier than the rest of the tribe, and hence do not talk about them
to outsiders. The narrator stated that the head man of the family
says that there is a tradition among them that they originally came
from the north and settled among the Moqui people, where they
have been so long that they have lost all knowledge of the northern
tribe and were not certain that they now spoke the language of
their progenitors. When any of the Moqui married into the family,
their children were always white. This discovery, if true and
there seems no reason for such a statement unless it be true is
interesting in this connection and may be looked upon by some
as a proof of the claim that about the year A. D. 400 a race of
white people occupied the territory bordering the southern shores
of the great lakes, and that they were driven away by red men
who came from still further north. Of course this is speculation
and will probably remain a mystery as long as the world stands.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Buzzard's Covering</span>, Page 77.&mdash;This legend regarding
the buzzard's plumage was often told by the Indians to illustrate
the failure of some one of their number to win success in marriage
or upon the chase. "We wear the turkey buzzard's feathers,"
said one of the Sioux chiefs a few years ago when making complaint
to a Congressional committee. Few of those who heard him understood
the metaphor and the supposition was that he referred to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"> 204 </a></span>
plainness of his clothing compared with that of the politicians who
met him. This expression coming from a Sioux chief proves that
at least some of the legends common among the Iroquois centuries
ago can be traced among the tribes of the West at the present
time. A white man to convey the same meaning would say, "We
have the worst end of the bargain," or, "We have only a crooked
stick at last."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Origin of the Violet</span>, Page 81.&mdash;The Indian term for the
violet is "heads entangled." This is not one of the legends told
by Cornplanter. It was told the author by a Seneca Indian named
Simon Blackchief. Afterwards the authenticity of the legend was
confirmed by inquiries among other members of the Seneca Nation.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Turtle Clan</span>, Page 85.&mdash;Of the various clans existing
among the Iroquois the Turtle was probably the most respected.
The families belonging to the Turtles were in reality the Freemasons
of those days and to them were accorded the highest honors. At
the council-fires the wisdom of the Turtles was displayed in counselling
unity of action. Their opinions were almost always accepted
without discussion.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Healing Waters</span>, Page 89.&mdash;The Indians possessed for
many years a knowledge of the curative properties of the mineral
springs of this country and held the waters in the highest veneration.
Their faith in them was so great that some did not hesitate
to declare that the waters would cure all ills. Another spring that
they held in high reverence was an oil spring situated in Allegany
County, New York State, near the Pennsylvania line. The water
of this spring is covered with a thick substance that was formerly
collected by the Indians by conducting the water into pools and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"> 205 </a></span>
skimming the surface with flat stones or the branches of trees. The
oil thus collected was used to mix with various substances to form
war-paint, but more especially as a healing salve for various
wounds. The Indians knew of its existence for many centuries,
and there were few days in summer when bands of Indians were
not in that vicinity gathering the oil, which they evaporated by
exposure to the sun and then stored in raw-hide or earthen vessels
for future use. Years ago the spring and a plot of ground one mile
square was set aside as a reservation, and it is still held as such. A
curious fact in this connection is that the oil from the spring was
vaseline in its crude state, and the same substance is now extensively
secured from petroleum oil wells in that vicinity.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Message Bearers</span>, Page 119.&mdash;The belief of the Indians
that the echoes they heard among the mountains and forests were
spirits who repeated from one to another the words spoken by the
men and women until the words reached Heaven itself, is almost
too beautiful to be destroyed by the cold facts of science. There
is something about their theory that appeals very strongly to all
and makes us wish that we, like the Indians of a thousand years
ago, could believe that our prayers, if spoken boldly, would be
caught from our lips by waiting and listening spirits and carried to
"the tent of the Great Spirit."</p>

<p>It was customary for them to frequent rivers with high wooded
banks, or to seek ravines with precipitous sides where reverberations
could be heard for miles, until they would die away in the
distance. Here they would stand for hours, shouting and listening
as the echoing shouts leaped from shore to shore, or from hill to
mountain and from mountain to valley&mdash;on and on into silence;
always firmly believing that the words were called from one to
another of the faithful spirits until they reached the ears of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"> 206 </a></span>
loved ones and finally the Great Spirit himself. This custom was
practiced among the Senecas less than one hundred years ago, and
there are now living men who have been present on occasions
when nearly the whole tribe participated in an event of this character.
This belief was doubtless the origin of the "death shout"
that Indian warriors are said to make when mortally wounded upon
the battle field. The cry is sent forth by the dying warrior to let
the friends whom he would meet in heaven know that he has
started on the long journey.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Hunter</span>, Page 129.&mdash;This legend is one of the many relating
the origin of the "medicine compound." When the rejoicing
over the return to life of Kanistagia had ceased, the bear and fox
took him aside and imparted the secret of the mysterious compound
which had mended his wounded head when once the scalp
had been restored. There has always been a great deal of mystery,
and something of superstition, concerning, "Indian medicines," and
quack nostrums have been eagerly sought by people of these later
years simply because they were labeled with Indian names and
ascribed to Indian origin. The fact is the Indians were poor doctors.
They knew the virtue of catnip, peppermint, pennyroyal,
and a few simple herbs of like nature. They knew that lobelia
would act as an emetic and throw poisons from the stomach.
They found that a salve made from the inner bark of the slippery
elm and elder would heal wounds. While they had an infinite
variety of so-called "medicines," their cures were generally effected
through faith and good constitutions, aided by a liberal use of cold
water. They lived out of doors during the greater part of their lives,
and to this, more than to their knowledge of cures, may be
ascribed their longevity.</p>

<p>The secret of their "great medicine" was imparted to but few,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"> 207 </a></span>
and the formula here given was told the author by one of the older
Jimmersons, a resident of the Seneca Reservation: Each year before
the coming of the frosts a meeting of the chiefs was held in one of
the largest wigwams. Those entitled to attend could not enter the
wigwam before dark. Each one brought with him several of the
rarest herbs, roots, branches of trees or fruits of which he had
knowledge, and often hundreds of miles had been traversed in the
search for some particularly scarce product. These, with a few
simple, fragrant herbs and a certain proportion of dry corn and
beans, were pounded into a pulpy mass. Each one present
assumed the character of some bird or animal, and they often
masqueraded to carry out the role. No words passed between
them, but a continual din was kept up as each one sounded the
cries of the bird or animal he represented. One would bark like a
fox, another caw like a crow, a third would growl like a bear, the
fourth, fifth and sixth chatter like squirrels, raccoons or ground-hogs.
Another would scream like a hawk, while others would
imitate the wild turkey, geese, ducks, etc. They worked rapidly,
for they must complete their task before the break of day. If one
closed his eyes in sleep, it was a sure sign that the plague would
come upon the tribe. At daylight the compound was divided,
carefully bestowed in panther skin pouches, and carried away for
future use.</p>

<p>The manner of administering it was as curious as its manufacture.
Water was dipped from a running stream in a wooden vessel.
Care was taken to dip with the current&mdash;never against it. When
the water in the vessel had become absolutely quiet, three small
portions of the powder were carefully dropped on its surface in the
form of a triangle. If the powder spread over the surface of the
water, as dust often will, the patient hastily gulped down the dose
and got well. If the powder sank to the bottom without spreading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"> 208 </a></span>
over the surface, the medicine man quickly departed with his
potion and no further effort was made to save the patient's life.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hiawatha</span>, Page 137.&mdash;This version of Hiawatha follows as
closely as it is possible to translate into English the legend as told
by Governor Blacksnake (The Nephew). This aged Seneca chief
was contemporaneous with Cornplanter, and died December 26,
1859, at the age of 117 or 120 years. He was a very intelligent
man, possessing all the nobler traits of his race and very few, if
any, of the baser ones. He possessed the confidence and esteem
of Washington, and to the day of his death wore upon a thong
around his neck a silver medal given him by Washington. He also
constantly carried a little leathern pouch containing a pass written
and signed by Washington's own hand.</p>

<p>It is believed that many will be pleased to read in prose the
beautiful story that Longfellow has immortalized in verse, and into
which he wove many other curious legends to make the story
complete. The form of the tradition here given is believed to be
the purest one extant. Its narrator repeated it frequently to
assemblages of the Senecas up to a few months prior to his
death, and as here given follows the story precisely as it came from
Blacksnake's own lips.</p>

<p>This legendary account of the formation of the confederacy of
the Iroquois differs materially from the historical account as given
by Cornplanter. The story of Hiawatha was believed by Cornplanter
as implicitly as any Christian believes the Bible. But he
said this happened so many years ago, when everything was
spiritual and supernatural, that the Five Nations in time came to
look upon it as something that was not binding upon them. By
degrees they drifted away and were estranged, and the council-fire
combined and lighted by Hiawatha at that time was permitted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"> 209 </a></span>
go out&mdash;that is, each tribe held its separate council. After the
second reunion of the tribes (see note and legend "The Confederation
of the Iroquois") the council was again established at Onondaga,
and the great council-fire was relighted on the spot hallowed
by the presence of their wisest leader. It is also interesting to note
that the councils of the Iroquois were held at Onondaga until January
18, 1777. In the War of the Revolution the Mohawks,
Onondagas, Senecas and Cayugas favored the English. The Mohawks
went to Canada and never returned, save as foes, till after
peace was declared, and the other tribes named lent the English
much assistance. The Oneidas and Tuscaroras remained neutral,
but really aided the Colonists. On the 19th of January, 1777, a
delegation of Oneida Indians visited Fort Stanwix (now Rome),
and told the commanding officer that the council-fire of the Iroquois
at Onondaga had the previous day been extinguished for all time.
What was probably the oldest confederacy in the world died in the
very infancy of American Independence.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Peacemaker</span>, Page 149.&mdash;The location of this "City of
Refuge" will, of course, never be known, and all that can be said
about it must be simply speculation. It seems reasonable to suppose
that it was located in a somewhat central position; where it
would be most convenient to all the tribes. From the fact that
Genetaska and her lover went southward to a river and took a
canoe to complete their wedding trip, it is believed that Kienuka
was situated in one of the three valleys in the central part of the
State of New York, drained respectively by the Tioughnioga, the
Chenango or the Unadilla rivers. The eloping couple are said to
have been the progenitors of a very intelligent tribe on Chesapeake
Bay, and probably reached their home by way of the Susquehanna
River. Elias Johnson, a Tuscarora Indian, gives a somewhat different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"> 210 </a></span>
version of this legend, and says that Kienuka was located four
miles eastward of the inlet of the Niagara gorge at Lewiston.
Although Mr. Johnson is possessed of much information as to the
early legends of his people, it is probable that he has erred in the
location of the peace-home. The location he points out would
have been manifestly unfair to the Mohawks and Oneidas, and, indeed,
it would have been very difficult of access to all the tribes,
for even the Senecas (the westernmost tribe) would have had to
make a journey of nearly a hundred miles to have gotten within
the sacred walls.</p>

<p>Wherever it was, Kienuka was a veritable "City of Refuge."
Its queen was chosen as indicated in the legend and her word became
law. There was absolutely no appeal from it. With three
or four retainers, who must be old women, she was supported by
all the tribes, and great quantities of food were stored at the retreat
for the relief of those who came there in distress. This must be
ready at all times for those who might be in want. Disputes were
not tolerated in the presence of the Peacemaker and would have
been punished by death if reported to the council. Every one who
reached the charmed circle was safe from molestation until the
Peacemaker had delivered her sentence. If for some offence the
refugee should be adjudged guilty of a crime punishable by death,
he must be taken far from the peace-home before the sentence
could be executed, for the shedding of blood within its pale was
strictly forbidden. For this reason, when deserted by Genetaska,
whose vows were forgotten in the love she bore the young Oneida,
Kienuka became the scene of bloodshed, and it was afterwards
shunned, accursed and desolated.</p>

<p>Six hundred years elapsed after the occurrence of this romantic
incident before the office of Queen Peacemaker was again filled.
The shock the Indians felt over the betrayal of such a high trust as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"> 211 </a></span>
that imposed in Genetaska led them to practically abolish the
venerated custom. In 1878 they bestowed the honor upon Caroline
Parker, a sister of General Eli S. Parker, a former member of
General Grant's staff. She was a resident of the Tuscarora Reservation,
and afterwards became the wife of John Mountpleasant. She
is possessed of a comfortable home and a fortune of moderate size.
She is a woman of education and refinement, and is in all respects
an ideal Peacemaker. Her home is ever open to the poor, distressed
and needy; her heart is moved by pity at every sign of
suffering; her sound judgment and fine sensibilities render her a
most valuable friend and counsellor.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">An Unwelcome Visitor</span>, Page 155.&mdash;This legend was as common
among the Indians as are the parables of the Prodigal Son or the
Good Samaritan among Christians. It was told to the young very
impressively and often, that they might learn by its teachings never
to refuse welcome and shelter to a stranger, no matter what his
condition, even though he be covered with the awful pustules of
smallpox, with which the visitor in the legend is supposed to have
been suffering. If they should refuse shelter, they might be, unawares,
turning "good medicine" from the door. This is also one
of the legends explaining the origin of the knowledge possessed by
the Indians of the curative properties of plants and roots. Unfortunately
the name of the benefactress of their race who figures in
the legend has been lost, but in all tribes and clans there have
been noted Sagawahs who were supposed to be her descendants.
As no one could enter the Happy Hunting-Grounds except through
the gate of death, the Great Spirit's messenger, who had gone
through much suffering for the welfare of the red men, brought
upon himself the "fatal disease"&mdash;consumption&mdash;for which the
Indians had no remedy.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
